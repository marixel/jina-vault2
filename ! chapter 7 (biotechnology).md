## 7.1: Plasmids and Gene Cloning
- ### 7.1.1: Biotechnology: Plasmids in Prokaryotes
	- [[biotechnology]]: the utilization of organisms and their components to perform functional tasks in research + to make products that are useful to humans
	- [[plasmids]]: small, circular pieces of DNA that're separate from bacterial [[chromosome]] and can carry [[genes]] that encode proteins w/ specific functions; self replicating
		- ![[plasmid_diagram.png]]
		- can code for:
			- the ability to form [[pili]], which are involved in [[bacterial conjugation]]
				- conjugation: process by which genetic material is transferred between two bacteria
				- plasmid can encode for a [[bacterium]]'s ability to form a [[pilus]] (plural: pili), which is a structure that connects two bacteria together and allows for the transfer of DNA from one bacterium to the other
				- ![[bacterial-conjugation-simple.png]]
			- antibiotic resistance: fungi produce chemicals called [[antibiotics]] that're able to kill bacteria (a natural competitor). bacteria that have a resistance plasmid are able to overcome specific antibiotics
			- **toxins**: some of the chemicals that bacteria produce can cause a person who has a bacterial infection to be ill; many of these chemicals are encoded in plasmids
			- **protective proteins**: some bacteria have protective protein coats that are encoded in plasmids
- ### 7.1.2: Using a Restriction Enzyme to Create a Vector
	- researchers can create specialized [[plasmids]] with a gene of interest inserted into them; these plasmids may then be placed into bacterial cells where they will be expressed
	- [[restriction enzymes]] or restriction [[endonucleases]] are enzymes that bacteria produce in order to cut foreign DNA  as a defense mechanism
		- ![[bacteriophage-inserting-DNA.png]]
			- [[bacteriophage]] (bacterial virus) inserting its DNA into a bacterial chromosome
			- to defend itself, bacterium uses [[restriction enzymes]] to cut the foreign DNA
			- once cut, DNA will be further broken down and used as building blocks for the bacterium's own use
		- cut DNA only at a specific sequence and most restriction enzymes make staggered cuts
		- resulting fragments have [[sticky ends]], which will be able to come back together due to of complementary base pairing between strands
		- biotechnologists often use the restriction enzyme [[EcoR1]], which makes a staggered cut at a specific sequence of DNA and results in sticky ends\
			- ![[EcoR1-diagram.png]]
				- diagram shows the cut that [[EcoR1]] makes
				- notice staggered cut at sequence GAATTC
					- only sequence that EcoR1 recognizes
			- named after E. coli strain R1
			- joining of fragments enabled by pairing of complementary nucleotides w/ any end that's formed from an EcoR1 cut
		- [[restriction enzymes]] are often used to insert a gene of interest into a plasmid
			- first, plasmid and gene of interest must be cut w/ same restriction enzyme (ex. EcoR1 in diagram below)
			- cut plasmid and gene of interest then mixed together w/ enzyme [[ligase]] and allowed to come together
			- ![[EcoR1-insertion-into-plasmid.png]]
- ### 7.1.3: Biotechnology: Gene Cloning
	- [[gene cloning]]: process by which multiple copies of a gene are produced
		- ![[gene-cloning.png]]
			- in diagram, bacterial plasmids that has a resistance gene (amp^R) is cut w/ a particular [[restriction enzymes]] (sing.)
				- at cut site is the lacZ gene.
			- DNA, w/ the human insulin gene somewhere in it, is cut w/ the same restriction enzyme
				- cut plasmids and cut DNA mixed tegether w/ [[ligase]], allowing [[sticky ends]] to connect and ligate
			- ![[gene-cloning-result.png]]
				- resulting plasmids put into bacteria by adding chemical such as calcium sulfate, which makes membrane more soluble
				- bacteria screened for presence of plasmid by being grown on a medium with [[ampicillin]]
					- bacteria that have plasmid will be resistant to [[ampicillin]]
				- bacteria then screened for presence of a gene inserted into the plasmid
					- if gene has been inserted into plasmid, then the lacZ gene (located at cut site) won't be functional
					- if no gene has been inserted into plasmid, lacZ will be fnctional
						- if lacZ = functional in plasmid, will cause color change in the medium if certain chemicals are used
						- bacteria that don't cause a color change are the ones that have a gene inserted into the plasmid
					- once bacteria have been screened for the presence of the plasmid and for the presence of a gene insert in the plasmid, the bacteria are then screened for the specific gene 
		- involves cutting genes out of a chromosome and inserting them into [[plasmids]], which can then be placed into bacteria, which will divide, forming multiple copies of gene
		- bacterial will also be able to express gene and form gene product
		- good plasmid for gene cloning must have particular restriction sites + genes that make it easily detectable
		- plasmid and gene of interest must both be cut w/ same restriction enzyme in order to create complimentary [[sticky ends]]
			- joining together of sticky ends allows gene to be easily inserted into the plasmids
		- plasmids w/ DNA insertions are placed into bacteria, which must then be screened for the presence of the gene of interest
		- 
- ### 7.1.4: Biotechnology: Detection of Cell Clones
	- as bacteria containing [[plasmids]] w/ inserted genes multiply, cell [[clones]] are produced
		- clones must be screened in order to determine which clones have plasmids containing the gene of interest
		- ![[screening-for-gene-of-interest.png]]
			- cells being screened for gene of interest must be cultured and then transferred to filter
				- cells must then be denatured to expose the DNA and separate the complementary strands of the DNA
			- DNA on filter then exposed to DNA probe
				- if probe matches sequence on the filter, then it'll hybridize to the DNA by complementary base pairing
				- filter must then be rinsed to wash off all excess unhybridized probe
			- filter then exposed to photographic film, which shows spots where it's been exposed to radioactive probes
				- images on film correspond to cells that contain gene of interest
	- shotgun approach to detecting bacteria for gene of interest = testing each colony for presence of gene or gene product of interest
		-  this method can be used to screen bacteria for presence of particular gene
		- [[DNA probe]]: synthesized segment of radioactively labeled DNA (or RNA) used to find a gene of interest
			- ![[DNA-probe.png]]
				- can be constructed using DNA segments containing [[radioisotope]]s (which give off radiation that can be detected on film)
				- sequence of a portion of the gene of interest must be known to construct probe segment that'll base-pair with a single strand of DNA
			- radioactive DNA probes can be constructed for the detection for specific DNA sequences within cells
			- will hybridize w/ complementary sequence of DNA, allowing it to be distinguished from other DNA sequences
## 7.2: Techniques in Biotechnology
- ### 7.2.1: Biotechnology: Reverse Transcriptase: A Tool Taken from Viruses
	- [[reverse transcriptase]]: enzyme that makes DNA from an RNA template
	- [[retroviruses]]: depend on reverse transcriptase to propagate themselves within a host cell
		- ![[visualizing-retroviruses.png]]
		- exception to the 'central dogma of biology'
		- can make DNA from RNA using reverse transcriptase. examples:
			- HIV
				- ![[HIV-visualization.png]]
				- beginning at top of diagram, [[HIV]] enters cell and uses reverse transcriptase to make a DNA strand from its RNA
				- synthesized DNA strand is then used as a template to make complementary strand of DNA
				- double-stranded DNA segment will then enter the nucleus of the host cell and integrate into the host chromosome
					- in the nucleus, RNA is transcribed from the viral DNA
				- after being translated by cell, viral RNA directs synthesis of viral protein, such as reverse transcriptase, and components of the viral coat
					- new viruses then assembled and bud off of the host cell
			- common cold
	- [[HIV]] (Human Immunodeficiency Virus), the virus that causes [[AIDS]], is a retrovirus that uses reverse transcriptase to multiply itself within a host cell
	- [[reverse transcriptase]] can also be used as a tool in [[biotechnology]]
