[[glycolysis]] is an [[anaerobic]] process that produces 2 [[ATP]], 2 NADH, and 2 [[pyruvate]] through the breaking down and oxidizing of [[glucose]]

bc it releases energy when broken

[[NAD+]] is the oxidized form of NADH; it's an abbreviation for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. it is reduced during cellular respiration to form NADH

the [[acetyl CoA]] step produces NADH + H+; CO2 during conversion of [[pyruvate]] to [[acetyl CoA]] (got this wrong)

during [[fermentation]], NADH is recycled back into [[NAD+]] to continue [[glycolysis]]

[[glycolysis]] is an anaerobic process involving the breakdown and oxidization of glucose into 2 ATP, 2 NADH, and 2 pyruvate molecules

the [[acetyl CoA]] step produces NADH + H+ and CO2

NAD+ is the oxidized form of NADH; it accepts electrons during respiration (ex. [[glycolysis]] and the [[acetyl CoA]] step)

the [[krebs cycle]] (or citric acid cycle) involves the conversion of the products of [[glycolysis]] into 2 ATP, 6 NADH + H+, and 2 FADH2 for each [[glucose]] molecule from [[glycolysis]]

the [[electron]] transport chain is made up of a series of exergonic redox reactions (electrons released) that create a [[proton]] gradient, which then fuels [[ATP]] synthesis
