## 1.1: Unity and Diversity of Life on Earth
- ### 1.1.1: Properties of Life
	- *Why are the worms alive?*
	- What makes something *alive*?
		- biologists **describe** life
	- key to life: ***organization***
		- life happens somewhere between molecules, organelles, and cells
		- organism = "multicellular," but describes everything w/ life
		- not all things w/ organization are alive
	- #### 6 characteristics of life:
		1. order
		2. reproduction
			- ability to reproduce at the molecular level (like DNA, cells, etc.)
			- sterile organisms can reproduce in this way
		3. growth and development
			- doesn't just refer to expansion
			- refers to creation of *new material*
		4. energy use (will show up later in class)
		5. response to environment
			- also called [irritability]
			- doesn't refer to physical or chemical changes
		6. homeostasis
			- synthesizes previous points
			- has to do w/ how life remains *balanced* to maintain a constant environment

## 1.2: Early Perspectives in Science
- ### 1.2.1: An Introduction to Biology
	- Biology mixes every science (a "kaleidoscope" of sciences) and tells us how the world works
	- Biology = the big picture in science
- ### 1.2.2: The Nature of Science: The Story of Darwin
	- #### Scientific Method
		1. observe
		2. hypothesize
		3. experiment
		4. collect data
		5. conclude
	- these steps will come naturally in time
	- #### science is about wonder and curiosity
		- hypotheses aren't "proven," they're either rejected or not (there are very, *very* few constants in science)
	- [[Charles Darwin]]
		- "forefather" of scientific thought
		- grandfather theorized natural selection (but nobody listened)
		- grew up wealthy, quit medical school, failed law school, and made it through divinity school
			- Darwin's teacher, **John Henslow**, got Darwin a place on the [[HMS Beagle]] (designated as the naturalist on board)
			- voyage went worldwide
			- few had faith in Darwin, and he could only go bc his uncle (and *only* his uncle) permitted that he should go
			- **Fitzroy**, captain of the [[HMS Beagle]], believed that Darwin was a divine intervention (because his trip's purpose was to disprove evolutionists/literally prove the Bible)
- ### 1.2.3: Early Scientific Thought
	```timeline 
	[line-4, body-4]
	+ 500-400 BC
	+ Aristotle
	+ 4 elements: fire, air, water, and earth<br>described world generally

	+ 200-1200 AD
	+ Age of Theology (No Science)
	+  

	+ 1200 AD
	+ Roger Bacon, Thomas Aquinas, and Albertus Magnus
	+ Bacon: reject dogma<br>Aquinas and Magnus: natural (from nature) vs revealed (theological) truths

	+ 1500 AD
	+ Francis bacon
	+ don't accept anything without a test (experimentation advocacy)

	+ 1600 AD
	+ Galileo, Newton, John Ray, and James Usher: Dawn of Science
	+ Galileo: supported Copernicus' theory (Earth = round and revolves around sun); forced to reject this theory to keep his life<br>Ray: found that fossils were remains of living things (an idea that couldn't be easily supported by theology)<br>Newton: physics and calculus<br>Usher: believed that world began in 4004 B.C.

	+ 1800 AD
	+ Darwin
	+ Darwin embarked on his journey when the bulk of the information above was new or not yet widely accepted as truth. Originally, he was an explorer, not a scientist
	```
- ### 1.2.4: The Emerging Science of Geology
	- John Ray started w/ fossil theory
	- George Cuvier (geologist; 1769-1832)
		- studied stratification (formation/structure of rock layers)
		- noticed that layers changed over time
			- theory: caused by catastrophic events ([[catastrophism]]; mass-extinctions)
			- deeper fossils = more and more unfamiliar (bc older)
	- James Hutton = proposed [[gradualism]] in 1785 to opposite Cuvier's idea
		- [[gradualism]]: earth is shaped oer tiem by geological process (slow, continuous change)
	- Charles Lyell (1797-1875)
		- [[uniformitarianism]]: forces involved in gradualism have not changed through Earth's history
			- so: few catastrophes and earth is >6000 years old
	- **opened doors** and **changed minds**
## 1.3: An Introduction to Evolution
- ### 1.3.1: Linnaeus, Buffon, and Lamarck
	- Linnaeus: **binomial system of nomenclature** (genus + species)
		- 2-name system of naming
		- 8-system animal kingdom
		- system allows for more in-depth analysis of life forms
	- Georges Buffon: "A Natural History of Animals"
		- animal anatomy
		- naturalist
		- while researching, **noticed**:
			- [[homologous]] structures: similar constructs between animals w/ varying structures derived from a common ancestor
			- vestigial structures: constructs w/o apparent use
	- Jean Baptiste de Lamarck: **first evolution theory**
		1. use or disuse
			- like weight training (more use = adapts to meet needs within lifetime; likewise, with less use the structure decays)
		2. inheritance of acquired characteristics
			- organisms pass on their traits from use/disuse to offspring
			- rarely true (think: two absolutely jacked , olympic-gold-medalist-in-lifting level parents would still have a fat, normally sized baby)
- ### 1.3.2: Darwin: The Voyage Continues
	- onboard, he read "Principles of Geology" by Lyell (uniformitarianism guy)
		- loved it and read second volume
	- first stopped at Cape Verde and found shell fossils **on a cliff** (far away from the water!)
	- found quadroped fossils in Argentina
		- biogeography: idea that life and geography are related
		- **questions: how did they get there? did they migrate? why extinct?**
		- also found horse fossils (previously believed that horses weren't native to South America and were introduced by Spain, but these fossils were too old for that to be the case)
	- experienced earthquake while in Chile which changed geological features (a few weeks layer, the elevation had increased by 9 ft/around 3 meters)
	- clam fossils in Andes Mountains and nearby forests
	- "Where are the rabbits?" (there were none in South America, though there *were* hares that shared the same purpose)
- ### 1.3.3: Darwin: More Observations
	- found fossils of giant sloths and armadillos
		- giants = ancestors of current generation?
	- Patagonian Hare in Patagonia (like said b4, had rabbit's role/[[niche]] bc there were no English rabbits in South America)
		- shared niche w/ English rabbits
		- concluded that **they developed separately** (this is ***huge!***)
	- in Galapagos islands, flora and fauna unique from creatures anywhere else
		- many different varieties bc of adaptations
		- islands were 600 miles from mainland
		- [[biogeography]] present (varieties)
			- therefore: **derived from a common ancestor**
- ***How did Darwin's observations of the English rabbit and Patagonian Hare vs. his observations of the Galapagos Islands' diversity differ? Why did he decide that the former two developed separately, and that the latter was derived from a common ancestor?***

## 1.4: Evolution: The Theory of Natural Selection
- ### 1.4.1: Darwin: Theory of Natural Selection
	- influencers for theories
		- Lyell's theory that continents moved ("Principles of Biology")
		- variations/resemblances, fossils, artificial selection, and "An Essay on the Principles of Population" by **Thomas Malthus**
			- humans will overpopulate Earth without disease, war, and famine
	- #### Darwin's theory (unpublished):
		1. species change over a long period of time
		2. number of species increase
		3. species descend from a common ancesto
		4. *natural selection* causes survivors to emerge
			- adaptation: trait in organism that helps it survive
			- *natural selection conditions:*
				- overpopulation, variety, and competition (**survival of the luckiest/fittest**)
- ### 1.4.2: Theory of Natural Selection
	- artificial selection example: Wild Mustard Plant
	- Darwin's work after return:
		- journal entries
		- book on coral atolls
		- 2 books on geology
		- definitive treatise on barnacles
	- when *finally* writing his theory to publish, A.R. Wallace came to similar observation (putting Darwin in trouble)
		- Darwin presented book to Linnaean Society in 1858 + published "The Origin of Species" in 1859
		- 1871: "The Origin of Man"
	- Darwin's Theory of Natural Selection
		1. overpopulation
		2. variation within a population
		3. competition in a population
		4. survival of the fittest/luckiest
		5. reproduction
- ### 1.4.3: Contrasting Lamarck vs Darwin (pt. 1)
	- a biologist asks: ***WHY?***
		- both Lamarck's and Darwin's theories provide a possible answer to the question of evolution
	- "Why do giraffes have long necks?"
		- Lamarck: giraffes stretch their necks during their lifetime to reach higher leaves and pass this trait on to their offspring
		- Darwin: a variety of giraffes are present within a population; those with longer necks can reach higher leaves, a luxury not present among the entire species. Those with shorter necks, being that they can only reach the overconsumed lower leaves, may starve, die, and leave those with the taller necks to survive and reproduce
- ### 1.4.4: Contrasting Lamarck vs Darwin (pt 2)
	- "How did the woodpecker get a cushioned head?"
		- Lamarck: woodpecker used its head a lot, causing it to grow stronger; this strengthened head is then passed on to its offspring
		- Darwin: woodpeckers in a population have varying beak and head thicknesses. There will only be enough food to sustain those w/ desirable traits (thicker beaks, cushioned heads.) The surviving variations will reproduce and pass on their traits to their offspring.
	- next question: What is the *source* of variation?
	- selective pressure: when an outside force affects the composition of a population by favoring certain traits over others
		- **how is this related to natural selection?**

## 1.5: Fossils and Evolution
- ### 1.5.1: Fossil Formation, Dating, and Indexing
	- Darwin's theory supported by fossils
		- fossils often found in sediment, ice, or amber
	- Sedimentation + fossil formation:
		- water covers dry environment, killing the organisms
		- over time, layers of sediment cover the organisms in the water
		- with enough sediment, water dries; remains are mineralized or leave imprints
	- Methods of dating fossils 
		- [[relative]] (indexing): older fossils in deeper layers
		- [[absolute]] (radiometric): often utilizes C14 (instead of C12); determine initial amount of C14 in fossil (determined by today's standards; imagine that the fossil is being buried today) and view how many C14 atoms are left in fossil
		- for very, very old fossils, U-235 can be used (as it has a half-life of 4.5 billion years)
- ### 1.5.2: The Fossil Record
	- Fossil Record Shows:
		- increasing diversity of life forms
		- coevolution: evolution in one group affecting changes in another
		- biological ages of earth
			- 3 bya: no fossils
			- 1 bya: *only* bacteria ([[pre-cambrian]] period)
			- 600 mya: algae + invertebrates ([[cambrian]] period + [[cambrian explosion]]
			- 500 mya: advanced marine algae, early vertebrates, jawless fish ([[Ordovician]]))
