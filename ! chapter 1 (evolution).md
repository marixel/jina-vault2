## 1.1: Unity and Diversity of Life on Earth
- ### 1.1.1: Properties of Life
	- *Why are the worms alive?*
	- What makes something *alive*?
		- biologists **describe** life
	- key to life: ***organization***
		- life happens somewhere between molecules, organelles, and cells
		- organism = "multicellular," but describes everything w/ life
		- not all things w/ organization are alive
	- #### 6 characteristics of life:
		1. order
		2. reproduction
			- ability to reproduce at the molecular level (like DNA, cells, etc.)
			- sterile organisms can reproduce in this way
		3. growth and development
			- doesn't just refer to expansion
			- refers to creation of *new material*
		4. energy use (will show up later in class)
		5. response to environment
			- also called [irritability]
			- doesn't refer to physical or chemical changes
		6. homeostasis
			- synthesizes previous points
			- has to do w/ how life remains *balanced* to maintain a constant environment

## 1.2: Early Perspectives in Science
- ### 1.2.1: An Introduction to Biology
	- Biology mixes every science (a "kaleidoscope" of sciences) and tells us how the world works
	- Biology = the big picture in science
- ### 1.2.2: The Nature of Science: The Story of Darwin
	- #### Scientific Method
		1. observe
		2. hypothesize
		3. experiment
		4. collect data
		5. conclude
	- these steps will come naturally in time
	- #### science is about wonder and curiosity
		- hypotheses aren't "proven," they're either rejected or not (there are very, *very* few constants in science)
	- [[Charles Darwin]]
		- "forefather" of scientific thought
		- grandfather theorized natural selection (but nobody listened)
		- grew up wealthy, quit medical school, failed law school, and made it through divinity school
			- Darwin's teacher, **John Henslow**, got Darwin a place on the [[HMS Beagle]] (designated as the naturalist on board)
			- voyage went worldwide
			- few had faith in Darwin, and he could only go bc his uncle (and *only* his uncle) permitted that he should go
			- **Fitzroy**, captain of the [[HMS Beagle]], believed that Darwin was a divine intervention (because his trip's purpose was to disprove evolutionists/literally prove the Bible)
- ### 1.2.3: Early Scientific Thought
	- ![[Pasted image 20230812040038.png]]
- ### 1.2.4: The Emerging Science of Geology
	- John Ray started w/ fossil theory
	- George Cuvier (geologist; 1769-1832)
		- studied stratification (formation/structure of rock layers)
		- noticed that layers changed over time
			- theory: caused by catastrophic events ([[catastrophism]]; mass-extinctions)
			- deeper fossils = more and more unfamiliar (bc older)
	- James Hutton = proposed [[gradualism]] in 1785 to opposite Cuvier's idea
		- [[gradualism]]: earth is shaped oer tiem by geological process (slow, continuous change)
	- Charles Lyell (1797-1875)
		- [[uniformitarianism]]: forces involved in gradualism have not changed through Earth's history
			- so: few catastrophes and earth is >6000 years old
	- **opened doors** and **changed minds**
## 1.3: An Introduction to Evolution
- ### 1.3.1: Linnaeus, Buffon, and Lamarck
	- Linnaeus: **binomial system of nomenclature** (genus + species)
		- 2-name system of naming
		- 8-system animal kingdom
		- system allows for more in-depth analysis of life forms
	- Georges Buffon: "A Natural History of Animals"
		- animal anatomy
		- naturalist
		- while researching, **noticed**:
			- [[homologous]] structures: similar constructs between animals w/ varying structures derived from a common ancestor
			- vestigial structures: constructs w/o apparent use
	- Jean Baptiste de Lamarck: **first evolution theory**
		1. use or disuse
			- like weight training (more use = adapts to meet needs within lifetime; likewise, with less use the structure decays)
		2. inheritance of acquired characteristics
			- organisms pass on their traits from use/disuse to offspring
			- rarely true (think: two absolutely jacked , olympic-gold-medalist-in-lifting level parents would still have a fat, normally sized baby)
- ### 1.3.2: Darwin: The Voyage Continues
	- onboard, he read "Principles of Geology" by Lyell (uniformitarianism guy)
		- loved it and read second volume
	- first stopped at Cape Verde and found shell fossils **on a cliff** (far away from the water!)
	- found quadroped fossils in Argentina
		- biogeography: idea that life and geography are related
		- **questions: how did they get there? did they migrate? why extinct?**
		- also found horse fossils (previously believed that horses weren't native to South America and were introduced by Spain, but these fossils were too old for that to be the case)
	- experienced earthquake while in Chile which changed geological features (a few weeks layer, the elevation had increased by 9 ft/around 3 meters)
	- clam fossils in Andes Mountains and nearby forests
	- "Where are the rabbits?" (there were none in South America, though there *were* hares that shared the same purpose)
- ### 1.3.3: Darwin: More Observations
	- found fossils of giant sloths and armadillos
		- giants = ancestors of current generation?
	- Patagonian Hare in Patagonia (like said b4, had rabbit's role/[[niche]] bc there were no English rabbits in South America)
		- shared niche w/ English rabbits
		- concluded that **they developed separately** (this is ***huge!***)
	- in Galapagos islands, flora and fauna unique from creatures anywhere else
		- many different varieties bc of adaptations
		- islands were 600 miles from mainland
		- [[biogeography]] present (varieties)
			- therefore: **derived from a common ancestor**
- ***How did Darwin's observations of the English rabbit and Patagonian Hare vs. his observations of the Galapagos Islands' diversity differ? Why did he decide that the former two developed separately, and that the latter was derived from a common ancestor?***

## 1.4: Evolution: The Theory of Natural Selection
- ### 1.4.1: Darwin: Theory of Natural Selection
	- influencers for theories
		- Lyell's theory that continents moved ("Principles of Biology")
		- variations/resemblances, fossils, artificial selection, and "An Essay on the Principles of Population" by **Thomas Malthus**
			- humans will overpopulate Earth without disease, war, and famine
	- #### Darwin's theory (unpublished):
		1. species change over a long period of time
		2. number of species increase
		3. species descend from a common ancesto
		4. *natural selection* causes survivors to emerge
			- adaptation: trait in organism that helps it survive
			- *natural selection conditions:*
				- overpopulation, variety, and competition (**survival of the luckiest/fittest**)
- ### 1.4.2: Theory of Natural Selection
	- artificial selection example: Wild Mustard Plant
	- Darwin's work after return:
		- journal entries
		- book on coral atolls
		- 2 books on geology
		- definitive treatise on barnacles
	- when *finally* writing his theory to publish, A.R. Wallace came to similar observation (putting Darwin in trouble)
		- Darwin presented book to Linnaean Society in 1858 + published "The Origin of Species" in 1859
		- 1871: "The Origin of Man"
	- Darwin's Theory of Natural Selection
		1. overpopulation
		2. variation within a population
		3. competition in a population
		4. survival of the fittest/luckiest
		5. reproduction
- ### 1.4.3: Contrasting Lamarck vs Darwin (pt. 1)
	- a biologist asks: ***WHY?***
		- both Lamarck's and Darwin's theories provide a possible answer to the question of evolution
	- "Why do giraffes have long necks?"
		- Lamarck: giraffes stretch their necks during their lifetime to reach higher leaves and pass this trait on to their offspring
		- Darwin: a variety of giraffes are present within a population; those with longer necks can reach higher leaves, a luxury not present among the entire species. Those with shorter necks, being that they can only reach the overconsumed lower leaves, may starve, die, and leave those with the taller necks to survive and reproduce
- ### 1.4.4: Contrasting Lamarck vs Darwin (pt 2)
	- "How did the woodpecker get a cushioned head?"
		- Lamarck: woodpecker used its head a lot, causing it to grow stronger; this strengthened head is then passed on to its offspring
		- Darwin: woodpeckers in a population have varying beak and head thicknesses. There will only be enough food to sustain those w/ desirable traits (thicker beaks, cushioned heads.) The surviving variations will reproduce and pass on their traits to their offspring.
	- next question: What is the *source* of variation?
	- selective pressure: when an outside force affects the composition of a population by favoring certain traits over others
		- **how is this related to natural selection?**

## 1.5: Fossils and Evolution
- ### 1.5.1: Fossil Formation, Dating, and Indexing
	- Darwin's theory supported by fossils
		- fossils often found in sediment, ice, or amber
	- Sedimentation + fossil formation:
		- water covers dry environment, killing the organisms
		- over time, layers of sediment cover the organisms in the water
		- with enough sediment, water dries; remains are mineralized or leave imprints
	- Methods of dating fossils 
		- [[relative]] (indexing): older fossils in deeper layers
		- [[absolute]] (radiometric): often utilizes C14 (instead of C12); determine initial amount of C14 in fossil (determined by today's standards; imagine that the fossil is being buried today) and view how many C14 atoms are left in fossil
		- for very, very old fossils, U-235 can be used (as it has a half-life of 4.5 billion years)
- ### 1.5.2: The Fossil Record
	- Fossil Record Shows:
		- increasing diversity of life forms
		- coevolution: evolution in one group affecting changes in another
		- biological ages of earth
			- 3 bya: no fossils
			- 1 bya: *only* bacteria ([[Pre-cambrian]] period)
			- 600 mya: algae + invertebrates ([[Cambrian]] period + [[Cambrian explosion]]
			- 500 mya: advanced marine algae, early vertebrates, jawless fish ([[Ordovician]]))
			- 400 mya: land plants + early arthropods ([[Silurian]] period)
			- 350 mya: [[tracheophytes]] + early amphibians ([[Devonian]] period)
			- 300 mya: **trees**, age of amphibians, early reptiles ([[radiation]] of amphibians because of no competition; [[Carboniferous]] period)
			- 250 mya: reptiles rule + small mammals ([[Permian]] period)
			- 60 mya: dinosaurs ruled + nocturnal, small mammals ([[Cretaceous]] Period)
- ### 1.5.3: Some Fossil Surprises
	- fossil record *provides evidence for evolution* and has had a few surprises
		- whales share more characteristics w/ mammals than fish
		- [[transitional]] fossils demonstrate this change (*why/how do they demonstrate this change? how does this support evolution?*)
			- ancestor = land-dwelling mammals
		- reptiles + birds
			- [[archeopteryx]]: reptile-looking bird creature
		- reptiles + mammals:
			-[[quadrate]] + [[articular]] bones in reptiles (jaw bones) become incus and malleus in mammals (inner-ear bones)
- ### 1.5.4: The Coevolution of Horses and Plants
	- **this section's purpose is to serve as a conceptual example, not as a list to memorize. see how you can apply what you learn here to other relationships**
	- first horse fossils around 65 mya
		- 64 mya: [[hyracotherium]]
			- size of a small dog; teeth adapted for biting small twigs (no grass yet)
			- no hooves bc forest was wet; horse-like jaw
		- 40 mya: [[mesohippus]]
			- 2 middle toes fused into one and teeth changed; helped as prairies began
			- 2 other toes = vestigial structures
		- [[cladogenesis]]: pattern of *branching* in the evolutionary tree **showing the emergence of new species**
			- **why significant? success rate(s)?**
- ### 1.5.5: Mass Extinctions: AACRYD
	- #### 5 mass extinctions (significant decrease in 3 of families)
		- Linnaean classification:
			- kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species
		- marks end of an age (roughly)
		- five ages: [[Ordovician]], [[Devonian]], [[Permian]], [[Triassic]], and [[Cretaceous]]
			- Ordovician: glaciers caused temperatures and water levels to drop
			- Devonian: presumably caused by continental collision
			- Permian: presumably caused by volcanic activity + cold environment on land
			- Triassic: maybe a meteor
			- Cretaceous: meteor(?) caused plants to die bc unable to perform photosynthesis

## 1.6: Human Evolution
- ### 1.6.1: Human Evolution: What is a Primate?
	- Darwin's theory of natural selection = often misinterpreted
		- humans + other primates share a **common ancestor**
		- doesn't mean that humans originated **directly** from "monkeys"
		- [[phylogeny]]: evolutionary history of species or group of related species
	- Features of Primates
		- opposable thumbs (for grasping)
		- nails instead of claws
		- front-facing eyes (ability for depth perception)
		- great/extended parental care
	- Classificiatoin of animals w/ Linnaean system
		- kingdom: animal
		- phylum: chordata
		- class: mammalia
		- order: primate
		- family: Hominidae
			- man diverges from ape at this level (familial)
	- **to find divergence between modern + ancient humans, must view fossil record and 'family trees' showing phylogeny**
- ### 1.6.2: Human Evolution: The Family Tree
	- primate phylogeny believed to have originated with "Ancestral arboreal (tree-dwelling) insectivores (insect-eaters)"
		- ~55 mya, split into 2 major suborders: [[prosimii]] and [[anthropoidea]]
			- [[prosimian]]: 
				- layer, prosimians split into smaller groups (less related to primates)
				- comparisons of anatomy determine tree placement
			- [[anthropoid]]:
			- physical similarities between splits + modern-day ppl begin w/ the second split (old world monkeys and apes)
			- after split separating lesser and greater apes, final split determined by fossil record
- ### 1.6.3: Human Evolution: The Fossil Record
	- monkey-ape split may be result of some monkeys being born w/ ability to move + live on the ground
		- w/ less competition, those on ground survived and reproduced, eventually forming **apes**
	- 15-18 mya: [[ramapithecus]]
		- shorter muzzle (like humans)
		- smaller canines (like humans)
	- ~4.5 mya: [[australopithecus]]
		- first true [[hominid]]
		- abt 1 meter tall
		- brain 1/3 size of human's
		- hip development
	- the genus Homo
		- smaller muzzles, larger brain cases
		- many varieties because of natural selection
	- [[species]]: narrowest defining group that can be assigned; organisms within a species can interbreed
	- #### **human evolution**: characterized by decreasing jaw size and increasing brain size
		- modern-day human skulls resemble [[neanderthal]] and [[Cro-Magnon]] skulls
	- [[australopithecus]] walked on 2 feet

## 1.7: Evidence for Evolution
- ### 1.7.1: Evidence for Evolution -- Biochemical Similarities
	- biochemical similarities: back up evidence for evolution
		- DNA makes proteins (in effect; DNA makes RNA makes Proteins)
		- [[hemoglobin]]: protein molecule w/ 4 sub-units found in red blood cells; functions to carry oxygen through cell
			- closer relations = similar hemoglobin structures (gorillas + humans have 1 [[amino]] [[acid]] difference)
		- [[DNA]]: molecule that carries genetic info in all living organisms
			- only ~2% makes proteins, so DNA chemical sequencing more accurate
			- human + chimps share 98.3% of DNA content
		- points of divergence from a common ancestry = ultimately caused by divergence in DNA
- ### 1.7.2: Evidence for Evolution: Vestigial Structures
	- vestigial structures tend to be disadvantages
	- #### [[Vestigial]] Structures:
		- present w/ no apparent function
		- **provide evidence of descent w/ mods**
		- example: appendix (remaining part of cecum)
			- og mammals: herbivores
			- couldn't digest cellulose in plants; cecum stored bacteria which could digest it
				- carnivores (+ omnivores by extension) didn't need it bc they didn't consume cellulose
				- cecum was just storing bacteria; if appendix is infected, will need to be removed
- ### 1.7.3: Homologous Structures
	- [[homologous]] structures: equivalent structures between different species bc of shared ancestry (same structure, different function)
	- [[convergent evolution]]: evolution of analogous structures between distantly related animals
	- during embryonic development, lots of homology bc of active genes that deactivate later on
	- **DNA record --> homology --> fossil record** (in terms of specificity)
	- homologous structures are determined by genetic inheritance

## 1.8: Species Concepts
- ### 1.8.1: Species Concepts
	- some organisms can/can't reproduce with each other
	- think Great Danes + Chihuahuas:
		- unlikely to mate in nature
		- different [[morphotype]]s
			- [[morphotype]]: categorization of individuals based on appearance ex. body shape, size, and coloring
		- could reproduce *biochemically*
	- **What defines a species?**
		- [[speciation]] event: occurrence of a new species
			- involves geography
		- Darwin "discovered" the Rhen (large, flightless bird) and determined that it developed apart from common group by a river
		- [[species]]: populations that can produce fertile offspring in wild, free-ranging environment
			- coyotes + dogs: fertile offspring, but don't mate in wild
			- lions + tigers: don't mate in wild and produce sterile/generationally inviable offspring
			- horses + donkeys: infertile offspring, may mate in wild
		- [[speciation]]: **continuous process** (so gray area will always be present)
- ### 1.8.2: Speciation
	- **when do organisms stop interbreeding?** Speciation guidelines (at least one must be followed)
		1. isolating events
			- geographic
				- interrupts [[gene flow]] (ability to reproduce)
		2. genetic divergence (2 ≤ gene populations in diff. environments vary w/ gene pools)
			- adaptive radiation: a great increase in species diversity over a relatively short time -- each variation adapts to new/unused resource or habitat
			- [[cladogenesis]] bc no competition
		3. reproductive isolation ([[Prezygotic]] or [[Postzygotic]])
- ### 1.8.3: Prezygotic Reproductive Isolation
	- [[zygote]]: fertilized egg
	1. Habitat (diet preference, etc.)
	2. Behavioral (courtship rituals; ex. male birds often bring food to females but females will reject food that they don't eat)
	3. Temporal (time; different breeding seasons)
	4. Mechanical (reproductive organs don't fit)
	5. Gametic (sperm doesn't recognize egg)
- ### 1.8.4: Postzygotic Reproductive Isolation
	- occurs when zygote is [[inviable]] (unable to survive)
	1. Hybrid Viability
		- [[hybridization]]: process of interbreeding between 2 geographically separated populations
	2. Hybrid Infertility
		-  [[zygote]] --> viable organism but unable to reproduce
		- ex. horse + donkey = mule (which is infertile) bc parents have different numbers of [[chromosomes]]
	3. Hybrid Breakdown
		- hybrid = viable + fertile, but offspring are inviable or infertile (ex. female ligers can be impregnated, but the fetus is most likely inviable)
- **to form a new species, parents must be different populations that can't reproduce with each other in a wild, free-ranging environment (because of isolation)**
	- elaborate? how do new species form in the wild??
## 1.9: Examples of Artificial and Natural Selection
- ### 1.9.1: Artificial Selection in Action
	- been studying evolution only for few hundred yrs
		- hard to experiment upon
	- [[Artificial Selection]]: selective breeding to produce offspring w/ desirable traits (so high frequency of desired traits in environment)
		- allows experimentation + study of *mechanisms* of evolution and [[natural selection]]
		- [[selective pressure]]: those w/ desirable traits will reproduce (ex. bacteria that are already resistant to initial dose of antibiotics when it comes through will reproduce and pass on this trait)
- ### 1.9.2: Natural Selection in Action
	- #### individuals with most fit more likely to survive and reproduce
	- [[population]]: members of the same species that occupy the same area
	- drastic changes in environment can alter [[selective pressure]] (ex. environment undergoes sudden change + formerly unsuccessful group now has ideal conditions)

## 1.10: The Origin of Life
- ### 1.10.1: History of Life: Overview of the Heterotroph Hypothesis
	- theory vs hypothesis
		- [[theory]]: an idea with overwhelmingly supportive evidence (as close to truth as can be achieved from a scientific standpoint)
		- [[hypothesis]]: *proposed* explanation for an observation
		- ex. [[Atomic Theory]] vs [[Heterotroph Hypothesis]]
	- first life: [[stromatolite]] (dome-shaped fossil w/ single-celled bacteria)
	- types of single-celled bacteria:
		- [[prokaryote]]: no nuclear membrane
			- bacteria
			- archaea
		- [[eukaryote]]: has nuclear membrane
	- next question: **how did life originate?** (be able to describe and maybe explain most plausible idea/heterotroph hypothesis)
- ### 1.10.2: The Heterotroph Hypothesis: An Introduction
	- **Oparin** and **Haldane's** hypothesis of primitive earth: "hot" from formation; [[reducing atmosphere]]
		- lots of chemical activity on surface as result
	- #### Reducing vs. Oxidizing Atmospheres:
		- **Reducing**: methane, H2O, NH3, H2; chemicals = reducing agents; donates electrons; allows [[synthesis]]
		- **Oxidizing**: O2; grabs electrons; no [[synthesis]] allowed
	- **make prediction:** what to go from abiotic --> biotic world?
		- quick chemical change, maybe?
	- **explain**: why would or wouldn't this be able to take place in our modern world?
		- wouldn't bc we have in an oxidizing atmosphere (prohibits synthesis)
- ### 1.10.3: The Origin of Life: Life from Nonlife
	1. [[synthesis]]: the making of [[organic]] [[molecules]]
	2. [[polymerization]]: bonding of simple molecules to make more complex molecules
	3. [[aggregation]]: collection of large molecules into an organized structure
	4. [[heredity]]: the passing on of information ([[reproduction]])
	- 1953: **Miller and Urey's experiment (recreated proposed conditions of early Earth's atmosphere)**
		- "hot thin soup" or the atmosphere (made up of [[life's building blocks]])
		- formed 20 [[amino]] [[acid]]s, simple sugars, and lipids (components of life)
		- demonstrates [[synthesis]] (formation of [[organic]] [[molecules]]!!!!)
	- **Sidney Fox's polymerization experiment:**
		- exposed amino acids to dry environment proposed for early Earth
		- [[amino]] [[acid]]s *formed [[proteins]]**
- ### 1.10.4: The Heterotroph Hypothesis: Protobionts
	- [[Protobionts]]: cell-like qualities, but unable to reproduce; chemistry occurs
		- involves [[aggregation]]
		- can form spontaneously from [[abiotic]]/nonliving materials
		1. [[coacervates]]: self-assemble, aggregate of molecules surrounded by water shell
			- [[enzymes]]: class of [[proteins]] serving as catalysts (proteins are like small test tubes; contained reactions)
		2. [[proteinoids]]: abiotically produced polypeptides that self-assemble to form microspheres (shell of proteinoids that self-assemble to surround water)
			- selectively permeable
		3. [[liposomes]]: lipid shells w/ water interiors
		- [[Heterotroph]]: something that takes in and processes materials (think [[heterotrophic organisms]])
- ### 1.10.5: The Heterotroph Hypothesis: The First Genetic Material
	- "How did these [[organic]] [[molecules]] get formed?"
	- [[reproduction]]/[[heredity]]
		- cellular: [[DNA]] stores hereditary material
			- [[DNA]] too complex to form spontaneously
			- [[RNA]] (simpler than DNA) makes proteins + thought to be **first genetic material*
	- [[RNA]] can form spontaneously + self-replicate (like some [[protobionts]]!); small pieces of [[RNA]] can form from other [[RNA]]
		- when proteins? 6
		- RNA can act as its own [[catalyst]]
			- instead of [[enzymes]], [[ribozymes]] (enzymatic RNA [[molecule]])
		- can bond to and release [[amino]] [[acid]]s
		- can make [[DNA]]
		- #### when combined w/ [[protobionts]], forms hereditary organism (a [[cell]]!!!)
- ### 1.10.6: The Origin of Life: The Rest of the Story
	- [[RNA]] may have given rise to [[DNA]]
		- ex. [[retroviruses]]
	- first cells "took in" energized molecules + broke bonds (following explains how environment went from reducing to oxidizing)
		- in breaking of bonds, CO2 released into atmosphere
		- anaerobic photosynthetic bacteria took CO2 and released oxygen into atmosphere
		- over a very long time, evolution exploded bc of oxygen in atmosphere
	- when [[proteins]] are mixed with cool water, [[microspheres]] form
	- [[coacervates]]' drops absorb environmental substrates and release products of chemical reactions
	- [[nucleic acid]]s are **not** capable of polymerizing [[replication reactions]]
## 1.11: Classifying Life
- ### 1.11.1: The Linnaean System
	- #### universal scientific language to name organisms
	- categorizes organisms by **evolutionary relationships**
	- kingdom, [[phylum]], class, order, family, [[genus]], and [[species]] (largest to smallest)
		- kingdoms expanded from 2 --> 5:
			- [[Monera]]: single-celled [[prokaryote]]s
			- [[Protista]]: single-celled [[eukaryote]]s
			- [[Plantae]]: multicellular organisms that perform [[Photosynthesis]]
			- [[Animalia]]: multicellular, [[heterotrophic]] consumers
			- [[Fungi]]: multicellular, [[heterotrophic]] absorbers
- ### 1.11.2: The Linnaean System: Still Changing
	- need to change 5-kingdom system as scientific knowledge grows
		- [[Protista]] + [[Monera]] = too broad
		- which: [[3-domain system]], [[5-kingdom system]], or [[8-kingdom system]]
			- [[Plantae]], [[Animalia]], and [[[Fungi]]: eukarya [[domain]]; same names (3-domain)
			- [[Protista]]: split into 3 or 5 groups (8-kingdom and 3-domain, respectively)
			- [[Monera]]: [[domain]] archaea + [[domain]] bacteria
				- common arching point?
