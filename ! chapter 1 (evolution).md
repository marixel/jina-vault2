## 1.1: Unity and Diversity of Life on Earth
- ### 1.1.1: Properties of Life
	- *Why are the worms alive?*
	- What makes something *alive*?
		- biologists **describe** life
	- key to life: ***organization***
		- life happens somewhere between molecules, organelles, and cells
		- organism = "multicellular," but describes everything w/ life
		- not all things w/ organization are alive
	- #### 6 characteristics of life:
		1. order
		2. reproduction
			- ability to reproduce at the molecular level (like DNA, cells, etc.)
			- sterile organisms can reproduce in this way
		3. growth and development
			- doesn't just refer to expansion
			- refers to creation of *new material*
		4. energy use (will show up later in class)
		5. response to environment
			- also called [irritability]
			- doesn't refer to physical or chemical changes
		6. homeostasis
			- synthesizes previous points
			- has to do w/ how life remains *balanced* to maintain a constant environment

## 1.2: Early Perspectives in Science
- ### 1.2.1: An Introduction to Biology
	- Biology mixes every science (a "kaleidoscope" of sciences) and tells us how the world works
	- Biology = the big picture in science
- ### 1.2.2: The Nature of Science: The Story of Darwin
	- #### Scientific Method
		1. observe
		2. hypothesize
		3. experiment
		4. collect data
		5. conclude
	- these steps will come naturally in time
	- #### science is about wonder and curiosity
		- hypotheses aren't "proven," they're either rejected or not (there are very, *very* few constants in science)
	- [[Charles Darwin]]
		- "forefather" of scientific thought
		- grandfather theorized natural selection (but nobody listened)
		- grew up wealthy, quit medical school, failed law school, and made it through divinity school
			- Darwin's teacher, **John Henslow**, got Darwin a place on the [[HMS Beagle]] (designated as the naturalist on board)
			- voyage went worldwide
			- few had faith in Darwin, and he could only go bc his uncle (and *only* his uncle) permitted that he should go
			- **Fitzroy**, captain of the [[HMS Beagle]], believed that Darwin was a divine intervention (because his trip's purpose was to disprove evolutionists/literally prove the Bible)
