## 1.1: Unity and Diversity of Life on Earth
- ### 1.1.1: Properties of Life
	- *Why are the worms alive?*
	- What makes something *alive*?
		- biologists **describe** life
	- key to life: ***organization***
		- life happens somewhere between molecules, organelles, and cells
		- organism = "multicellular," but describes everything w/ life
		- not all things w/ organization are alive
	- #### 6 characteristics of life:
		1. order
		2. reproduction
			- ability to reproduce at the molecular level (like DNA, cells, etc.)
			- sterile organisms can reproduce in this way
		3. growth and development
			- doesn't just refer to expansion
			- refers to creation of *new material*
		4. energy use (will show up later in class)
		5. response to environment
			- also called [irritability]
			- doesn't refer to physical or chemical changes
		6. homeostasis
			- synthesizes previous points
			- has to do w/ how life remains *balanced* to maintain a constant environment
