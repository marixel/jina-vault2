### NOT the same as the [[cell wall]]
- described as an "[[extracellular matrix]]"

- plasma membrane [[protein]]s involved w/ [[extracellular matrix]] anchored on inside of cell to [[actin filaments]]
	- involved in secretion and excretion of [[protein]]s
	- individual components of membrane can migrate relative to each other
	- selectively [[permeable]] (regulates which contents of [[interstitial fluid]] can enter cell)
