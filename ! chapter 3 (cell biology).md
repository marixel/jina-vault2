1. Cytosol :: Gel-like fluid that makes up the intracellular space within the cell. It is the liquid component of the cytoplasm and where many cellular processes occur, such as protein synthesis and metabolism.
<!--ID: 1691317922760-->


2. Extracellular Matrix (ECM) :: Non-living, supportive structure found outside the cells in multicellular organisms. It consists of various proteins, including collagen, as well as other molecules like proteoglycans and glycoproteins. The ECM provides mechanical support and helps cells adhere to tissues.

## 3.1: An Introduction to Cell Biology
- ### 3.1.1: The History of Cytology
	- Robert Hooke: first person to observe cells w/ microscope
		- tested w/ cork strip + cells only had air
		- concluded: structure of cells determines function
	- Lorenz Oken: all organic beings from [[vesicle]]s of cells
		- similar to [[cell theory]]
		- Lamarck had similar idea
	- Schleiden + Schwann: [[Cell Theory]] (all living things have cells)
		- Virchow: added on; "cells from from preexisting cells" ([[biogenesis]])
			- "proven" soon after by Louis Pasteur

- ### 3.1.2: Prokaryotes vs Eukaryotes
	- 2 types of major cells:
		- Eukaryotic: evolved after nucleus ([[eukaryote]]s)
			- membrane-bound organelles
			- 1-100 microns in size
		- Prokaryotic: evolved before nucleus, but has DNA
			- [[microbe]]s: generic term for [[prokaryote]]
			- no membrane-bound organelles
			- DNA = 1 circular chromosome
			- [[nucleoid]]: DNA concentration but no membrane
			- 1-10 microns in size
- ### 3.1.3: Plant and Animal Cell Overview: The Basics
	- [[compartmentalism]]: process by which cells develop organelles/compartments for efficiency
		- allows for specialization
		- in *all* eukaryotic cells
	- plants + animals' cells have plasma membranes
		- surround + regulate materials going in/out of cells
		- giant amoebas don't exist bc surface-area-to-volume ratios set limits on cell size (as cell grows large, it has less surface area available to exchange materials with environment)
- ### 3.1.4: Membranes: Basic Structures
	- membranes can separate cell from exterior, or organelles from the cell environment
	- [[cytoplasm]]: all cell contents (w/o nucleus)
		- [[cytosol]]: liquid part of cytoplasm
	- [[microvilli]]: cytoplasmic extension of plasma membrane
	- **Fluid Mosaic Model** (fluid pattern/basic membrane structure):
		- phospholipid bilayer w/ floating proteins (bc of versatility)
		- hydrophobic interior + hydrophilic exterior on both sides
			- protein orientations: on surface, partially embedded in surface, through both layers, or entirely between both layers

- ### 3.1.5: The Nuclear Envelope: The Initial Tour
	- structure and function are related + there are some consistent structures in all eukaryotic cells
	- the nucleus:
		- contains genetic material
		- membrane (nuclear envelope: doubled-up phospholipid bilayer surrounding nucleus
			- pores surrounded by "pore complex" proteins (let materials in/out)
	- [[nucleolus]]: assembles ribosomes (which can then leave through pores)
	- [[nuclear lamina]]: proteins in nuclear envelope holding nucleus together + keepings its shape

- ### 3.1.6: Nuclear Function: Who's in Charge?
	- ans: no one! cell functions *collectively*
	- nuclear function:
		- chromatic stores genetic material (DNA --> RNA)
		- proteins: *very important*
			- enzyme
			- membranes
			- catabolism: complex --> simple (breakdown)
			- anabolism: simple --> complex (synthesis)
		- *all code* for cell in DNA
			- RNA carries messages
			- Proteins carry out work

## 3.2: Membrane-Bound Organelles
- ### 3.2.1: Cellular Function: Endoplasmic Reticulum
	- The Endomembrane System:
		- a network of membrane-enclosed canals responsible for formation + excretion of proteins
		- protein has to be packaged to leave cell (done by this system)
		- Endoplasmic reticulum (ER): network of canal-like + flattened sack structures throughout cell
			- 2 types:
				- rough: covered in ribosomes (processes/alters proteins)
					- lumen: cavity inside tubular part of an organ
				- smooth: lacking ribosomes (processes proteins + attached to rough ER)
					- synthesis of phospholipids + steroids; detoxification
					- excess can lead to too-quick detoxification or breakdown of necessary substances for cell

- ### 3.2.2: Cellular Function: Golgi Apparatus
	- The Golgi Apparatus: prepares proteins for other jobs in/out of cell
		- the "post office" bc packages + prepares proteins
		- [[cisternae]] (or "faces"): membrane "sacs" of Golgi apparatus
			- cis: ER side
				- membrane fusion: merging of membranes to move protein w/o letting it into cytosol
			- trans: plasma membrane (controls secretion)
		- steps:
			- 1. formation of transport vesicle (protein "bag")
			- 2. transport vesicle fuses w/ cis face of Golgi
			- 3. protein travels from cisterna --> cisterna through vesicles
			- 4. protein leaves trans face in vesicle ready for transport
				- [[exocytosis]]: process of releasing materials through the plasma membrane
- ### 3.2.3: Food Vacuole Formation: The Role of the Lysosomes
	- lysosome: membrane-bound organelles w/ digestive/hydrolytic enzyme
	- amoeba: eats via "phagocytosis" (engulfing extracellular particles by surrounding them w/ extensions of the plasma membrane called "pseudopods")
		-  lysosome w/ digestive enzymes fuses w/ food vacuole, breaks organism down
	- organelle recycling: autophagy ("self-eating")
		- organelles broken down (like tadpole tail)
	- breakdown of lipids in brain
		- may malfunction; ex Tay-Sachs disease

- ### 3.2.4: Still More Vacuoles and Peroxisomes
	- water vacuoles: important in plants
		- makes up majority of plant cell to store water
		- also includes proteins, ions, and toxic wastes (toxins from plants)
	- contractile vacuoles: pumps out water from animal cells (water gets in via osmosis)
	- Peroxisomes: contains enzymes (peroxidase) that break down hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)
		- bound by 1 membrane
		- produces + disposes of H2O2

- ### 3.2.5: Mitochondria: Welcome Guests
	- mitochondria: organelles in eukaryotic cells that serve as the site for aerobic respiration (energy release)
		- the "powerhouse" of the cell
		- double-membrane system w/ inner being folded (folds = cristae)
			- cristae increase surface area to allow for more reactions
			- **theory of [[endosymbiosis]]** (process by which 2 organisms evolve to live inside each other) may apply to mitochondria

- ### 3.2.6: The Origin of Mitochondria and Chloroplasts
	- mitochondria and chloroplasts may have been introduced via phagocytosis (see 3.2.3)
		- possible evidence that mitochondria's from prokaryotes:
			- 1. similar sizes between mitochondria + prokaryotes
			- 2. circular chromosomes
			- 3. both lack histones in DNA
			- 4. have prokaryotic ribosomes
			- 5. high homology between DNA
		- chloroplasts: high energy in plants
			- ribosomal RNA homologous w/ prokaryotic RNA
			- center for photosynthesis + chlorophyll storage

## 3.3: The Cytoskeleton
- ### 3.3.1: The Cytoskeleton: Basic Components
	- cytoskeleton: fibers and filaments that help maintain cell shape + permit cell movement
		- 3 main components:
			- 1. microfilaments (made of actin; responsible for shape + contraction)
				- cleavage furrow forms during cell division)
				- pseudopods form when microfilament contracts (when actin is removed, microfilament shortens and pulls *anchor points* together)
				- structural support for microvilli
			- 2. intermediate filaments (wider than microfilaments)
				- may belong to keratin family
			- 3. microtubules (tubulum dimers; proteins stack spirally to make hollow tube)
				- allows for flexibility + ability to change size

- ### 3.3.2: Centrioles, Flagella, and Cilia
	- [[centrioles]]: pair of structures made from microtubules enabling chromosomal movement during cell division (3 microtubules arranged in 9+0 arrangement)
	- [[flagella]]: long + made of microtubules allowing for propulsion/movement outside cell
		- ex. sperm
	- [[cilia]]: short, hairlike projections made w/ microtubules serving to propel organisms using a rowing function
		- **protein motor molecule:** enables movement between microtubules
		- how microtubules move: protein motor molecules bind to adjacent pairs of microtubules + provide force for bending and movement

- ### 3.3.3: Cell Walls
	- basal body: at base of every cilia + flagella; becomes centriole in egg
	- cell walls:
		- consists of [[peptidoglycan]] (prokaryotic bacteria), chitin (in fungi), and cellulose (in plants)
			- so, structural material
		- primary: allows expansion + cell wall formation after cell division
			- hardened by pectin (which binds cellulose)
		- secondary: 2-3 more layers between plasma membrane + primary + secondary (pectin) cell walls
		- plasmodesmata: cytoplasmic channels running through adjacent plant cells

## 3.4: The Plasma Membrane
- ### 3.4.1: Plasma Membrane: The Extracellular Matrix
	- extracellular matrix: only in animals cells
		- integrated network of collagen, carbs, and proteins provide cellular support
		- components:
			- 1. glycoproteins (like collagen; mostly protein)
			- 2. proteoglycans (95% carbs)
			- 3. fibronectins (anchors proteins w/ others)
			- 4. plasma membrane (ex integrin; helps "lock" ECM + provides support with actin)

- ### 3.4.2: The Plasma Membrane: The Fluid-Mosaic Model
	- "Fluid Mosaic Model" bc protein molecules embedded in lipid bilayer
		- cells live in watery environments, but lipids are hydrophobic
		- selective permeability: ability to allow certain molecules to pass more easily than others
			- hydrophilic molecules have trouble
			- hydrophobic + fat-soluble molecules pass easily
			- lipids: constantly flowing
		- fluidity high bc bent tail adds space/minimizes Van der Waals interactions
			- cholesterol increases fluidity, so cold-blooded organisms may have them (since it doesn't allow for easy solidification)

- ### 3.4.3: Proteins as the Mosaic of the Cell Membrane
	- how do polar molecules (aside from water) get through lipid bilayer?
		- **proteins!**
		- vesicles from Golgi contain proteins on outside *or* inside bind to membrane
			- proteins integrate into membrane (through/integral or on surface/peripheral)
			- protein functions:
				- 1. transport (form tunnels)
				- 2. enzymes (molecules transform along metabolic pathway)
				- 3. signal transduction (can convey signals across membranes, may undergo conformational changes)
				- 4. junctions
				- 5. cell-cell recognition (oligosaccharide can identify its cell to protein of another cell)
				- 6. anchors (collagen + extracellular matrix)
- ### 3.4.4: Animal Cell Junctions
	- cells *must* communicate
		- accomplished w/ cell junctions
		- types of cell junctions:
			- 1. tight (no intercellular space; lets material enter w/o leakage + prevent drifting)
			- 2. desmosomes (fibers made of keratin + bind adjacent cells together)
				- high tensile strength
				- "rivets"
			- 3. gap (communication between cells + permit intercellular transport between 2 adjacent cells)

## 3.5: Cell Transport
- ### 3.5.1: Simple and Facilitated Diffusion
	- passive transport: movement of molecules across a cell that *doesn't require ATP*
	- diffusion: movement of molecules to areas of high -> low concentrations
		- determinants:
			- 1. [[concentration]] gradient
			- 2. temperature
			- 3. charge/polarity
			- 4. size/diameter of molecule
		- [[facilitated diffusion]]: passive transport w/ protein help
			- applies to molecules unable to get past membrane
			- protein undergoes shape change after molecule enters

- ### 3.5.2: Passive Transport: Osmosis
	- osmosis: passage of water across a membrane from high -> low concentration
	- hypertonic + hypotonic (relative to each other):
		- hypertonic: solute (yes solute)
		- hypotonic: water (no solute)
		- isotonic: same concentration
	- osmosis in plants:
		- hypotonic = turgid ($\ce{H2OE -> P}$)
		- isotonic = flaccid ($\ce{H2OP = E}$)
		- hypertonic = plasmolysis ($\ce{H2OP -> E}$)

- ### 3.5.3: Active Transport: Ion Pumps and Cotransport
	- equilibrium: no net movement on either side of reaction
	- ATP is exergonic
	- Active Transport: low -> high concentration
		- element/molecule being sought out will be forcibly moved to attractor (ex. iodine in thyroid)
		- electrogenic pump: protein actively transporting ions resulting in ionic + voltage gradient (which fuels other processes)
			- aka ion pumps
			- cotransport: coupled passage of 2 materials across a membrane (ex. hydrogen "opens the door" to sucrose to enter the cell)

- ### 3.5.4: Active Transport: The Sodium-Potassium Pump
	- sodium potassium pump occurs in neutrons (nerve cells)
		- at rest, neurons maintain polarization across cell membranes
		- focus = ions
			- equilibrium of potassium in cell
		- after stimulus:
			- 1. gated channels open and sodium ions rush in
			- 2. to reestablish exterior positivity, sodium bonds w/ transport protein
			- 3. ATP transfers phosphate group to protein
			- 4. phosphorylation causes protein conformational change, sodium ions pushed outside
			- 5. phosphate group released from protein as inorganic phosphate
			- 6. protein receptive to potassium ions from outside cell + bring them into cell
			- 7. protein returns to original conformation and is ready to accept sodium ions

- ### 3.5.5: Energy-Requiring Transport: Endocytosis and Exocytosis
	- exocytosis vs endocytosis
		- exocytosis: fuses w/ bilayre
		- endocytosis: molecules go into cell
			- types:
				- 1. phagocytosis (cell eating)
				- 2. pinocytosis (cell drinking; vesicle forms for fluid intake)
				- 3. receptor-mediated endocytosis (vesicle forms when molecules are hooked into receptor proteins)

## 3.6: Tools for Cell Biology
- ### 3.6.1: Tools of the Cytologist: Light and Fluorescent Microscopy
	- microscopes:
		- magnification: bending + focusing of light for enlarging of an object
		- resolution: clarity/ability to discern between two separate points
			- shorter light wavelength = higher resolution
			- limited to white light, but fluorescent dyes + stains help but don't completely solve the problem

- ### 3.6.2: Scanning and Transmission Electron Microscopes
	- transmission electron microscopes: electrons pass through materials instead of light to minimize wavelength
		- filament excites electrons
		- lenses = electromagnets
		- phosphorescent dyes glow when electron beam hits
		- 2D img
	- scanning electron microscope
		- object mounted on gold stub + specimen coated in metal
		- electrons bounce off object + energy levels of electrons computed to form 3D img

- ### 3.6.3: Freeze Fracture and Differential Centrifugation
	- freeze fracture/etching:
		- cell/tissue surrounded in ice
		- knife inserted + cell ruptures
		- natural areas that can rupture include hydrophobic tail of lipid bilayer
			- holes + bumps left over
		- allows for study of interior's topography
	- differential centrifugation: liquid suspension = separated and subjected to increasing speeds in a centrifuge
		- homogenate ground up + spun in centrifuge
		- densest material put into another tube + spun faster
		- liquid layers will separate materials by density, allowing you to pick out and study different materials

## 3.7: The Evolution of Metabolic Functions
- ### 3.7.1: Major Modes of Nutrition Among Organisms
	[[energy usage is a characteristic of life]]
a [[nutrient]] ([[food]]) provides [[chemical energy]] and raw materials for growth and repair

### How do organisms take in their food?
- [[autotrophic]]: make their own food by taking in raw materials
	- [[autotrophic organisms]]
		- bacteriochlorophyll: example
		- **[[photoautotrophs]]**: use *light* energy to make their own food
		- **[[chemoautotrophs]]**: uses chemical energy *other than light* to make their own food
- [[heterotrophic]]: takes in food from environment
	- so food comes directly from environment, unlike autotrophs (which take and compile components)
	- [[heterotrophic organisms]] (animals, bacteria, fungi, & protists)
		- **[[chemoheterotrophs]]**: animals obtaining energy/carbon from organic compounds
		- **[[photoheterotrophs]]**: uses light as energy source after obtaining carbon from organic compounds
