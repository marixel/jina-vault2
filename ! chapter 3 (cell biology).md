2. Extracellular Matrix (ECM) :: Non-living, supportive structure found outside the cells in multicellular organisms. It consists of various proteins, including collagen, as well as other molecules like proteoglycans and glycoproteins. The ECM provides mechanical support and helps cells adhere to tissues.
