1. Cytosol :: Gel-like fluid that makes up the intracellular space within the cell. It is the liquid component of the cytoplasm and where many cellular processes occur, such as protein synthesis and metabolism.
<!--ID: 1691317922760-->


2. Extracellular Matrix (ECM) :: Non-living, supportive structure found outside the cells in multicellular organisms. It consists of various proteins, including collagen, as well as other molecules like proteoglycans and glycoproteins. The ECM provides mechanical support and helps cells adhere to tissues.

## 3.1: An Introduction to Cell Biology
- ### 3.1.1: The History of Cytology
	- Robert Hooke: first person to observe cells w/ microscope
		- tested w/ cork strip + cells only had air
		- concluded: structure of cells determines function
	- Lorenz Oken: all organic beings from [[vesicle]]s of cells
		- similar to [[cell theory]]
		- Lamarck had similar idea
	- Schleiden + Schwann: [[Cell Theory]] (all living things have cells)
		- Virchow: added on; "cells from from preexisting cells" ([[biogenesis]])
			- "proven" soon after by Louis Pasteur

- ### 3.1.2: Prokaryotes vs Eukaryotes
	- 2 types of major cells:
		- Eukaryotic: evolved after nucleus ([[eukaryote]]s)
			- membrane-bound organelles
			- 1-100 microns in size
		- Prokaryotic: evolved before nucleus, but has DNA
			- [[microbe]]s: generic term for [[prokaryote]]
			- no membrane-bound organelles
			- DNA = 1 circular chromosome
			- [[nucleoid]]: DNA concentration but no membrane
			- 1-10 microns in size
- ### 3.1.3: Plant and Animal Cell Overview: The Basics
	- [[compartmentalism]]: process by which cells develop organelles/compartments for efficiency
		- allows for specialization
		- in *all* eukaryotic cells
	- plants + animals' cells have plasma membranes
		- surround + regulate materials going in/out of cells
		- giant amoebas don't exist bc surface-area-to-volume ratios set limits on cell size (as cell grows large, it has less surface area available to exchange materials with environment)
- ### 3.1.4: Membranes: Basic Structures
	- membranes can separate cell from exterior, or organelles from the cell environment
	- [[cytoplasm]]: all cell contents (w/o nucleus)
		- [[cytosol]]: liquid part of cytoplasm
	- [[microvilli]]: cytoplasmic extension of plasma membrane
	- **Fluid Mosaic Model** (fluid pattern/basic membrane structure):
		- phospholipid bilayer w/ floating proteins (bc of versatility)
		- hydrophobic interior + hydrophilic exterior on both sides
			- protein orientations: on surface, partially embedded in surface, through both layers, or entirely between both layers

- ### 3.1.5: The Nuclear Envelope: The Initial Tour
	- structure and function are related + there are some consistent structures in all eukaryotic cells
	- the nucleus:
		- contains genetic material
		- membrane (nuclear envelope: doubled-up phospholipid bilayer surrounding nucleus
			- pores surrounded by "pore complex" proteins (let materials in/out)
	- [[nucleolus]]: assembles ribosomes (which can then leave through pores)
	- [[nuclear lamina]]: proteins in nuclear envelope holding nucleus together + keepings its shape

- ### 3.1.6: Nuclear Function: Who's in Charge?
	- ans: no one! cell functions *collectively*
	- nuclear function:
		- chromatic stores genetic material (DNA --> RNA)
		- proteins: *very important*
			- enzyme
			- membranes
			- catabolism: complex --> simple (breakdown)
			- anabolism: simple --> complex (synthesis)
		- *all code* for cell in DNA
			- RNA carries messages
			- Proteins carry out work

## 3.2: Membrane-Bound Organelles
- ### 3.2.1: Cellular Function: Endoplasmic Reticulum
	- The Endomembrane System:
		- a network of membrane-enclosed canals responsible for formation + excretion of proteins
		- protein has to be packaged to leave cell (done by this system)
		- Endoplasmic reticulum (ER): network of canal-like + flattened sack structures throughout cell
			- 2 types:
				- rough: covered in ribosomes (processes/alters proteins)
					- lumen: cavity inside tubular part of an organ
				- smooth: lacking ribosomes (processes proteins + attached to rough ER)
					- synthesis of phospholipids + steroids; detoxification
					- excess can lead to too-quick detoxification or breakdown of necessary substances for cell

- ### 3.2.2: Cellular Function: Golgi Apparatus
	- The Golgi Apparatus: prepares proteins for other jobs in/out of cell
		- the "post office" bc packages + prepares proteins
		- [[cisternae]] (or "faces"): membrane "sacs" of Golgi apparatus
			- cis: ER side
				- membrane fusion: merging of membranes to move protein w/o letting it into cytosol
			- trans: plasma membrane (controls secretion)
		- steps:
			- 1. formation of transport vesicle (protein "bag")
			- 2. transport vesicle fuses w/ cis face of Golgi
			- 3. protein travels from cisterna --> cisterna through vesicles
			- 4. protein leaves trans face in vesicle ready for transport
				- [[exocytosis]]: process of releasing materials through the plasma membrane
- ### 3.2.3: Food Vacuole Formation: The Role of the Lysosomes
	- lysosome: membrane-bound organelles w/ digestive/hydrolytic enzyme
	- amoeba: eats via "phagocytosis" (engulfing extracellular particles by surrounding them w/ extensions of the plasma membrane called "pseudopods")
		-  lysosome w/ digestive enzymes fuses w/ food vacuole, breaks organism down
	- organelle recycling: autophagy ("self-eating")
		- organelles broken down (like tadpole tail)
	- breakdown of lipids in brain
		- may malfunction; ex Tay-Sachs disease

- ### 3.2.4: Still More Vacuoles and Peroxisomes
	- water vacuoles: important in plants
		- makes up majority of plant cell to store water
		- also includes proteins, ions, and toxic wastes (toxins from plants)
	- contractile vacuoles: pumps out water from animal cells (water gets in via osmosis)
	- Peroxisomes: contains enzymes (peroxidase) that break down hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)
		- bound by 1 membrane
		- produces + disposes of H2O2

- ### 3.2.5: Mitochondria: Welcome Guests
	- mitochondria: organelles in eukaryotic cells that serve as the site for aerobic respiration (energy release)
		- the "powerhouse" of the cell
		- double-membrane system w/ inner being folded (folds = cristae)
			- cristae increase surface area to allow for more reactions
			- **theory of [[endosymbiosis]]** (process by which 2 organisms evolve to live inside each other) may apply to mitochondria

- ### 3.2.6: The Origin of Mitochondria and Chloroplasts
	- mitochondria and chloroplasts may have been introduced via phagocytosis (see 3.2.3)
		- possible evidence that mitochondria's from prokaryotes:
			- 1. similar sizes between mitochondria + prokaryotes
			- 2. circular chromosomes
			- 3. both lack histones in DNA
			- 4. have prokaryotic ribosomes
			- 5. high homology between DNA
		- chloroplasts: high energy in plants
			- ribosomal RNA homologous w/ prokaryotic RNA
			- center for photosynthesis + chlorophyll storage

## 3.3: The Cytoskeleton
- ### 3.3.1: The Cytoskeleton: Basic Components
	- cytoskeleton: fibers and filaments that help maintain cell shape + permit cell movement
		- 3 main components:
			- 1. microfilaments (made of actin; responsible for shape + contraction)
				- cleavage furrow forms during cell division)
				- pseudopods form when microfilament contracts (when actin is removed, microfilament shortens and pulls *anchor points* together)
				- structural support for microvilli
			- 2. intermediate filaments (wider than microfilaments)
				- may belong to keratin family
			- 3. microtubules (tubulum dimers; proteins stack spirally to make hollow tube)
				- allows for flexibility + ability to change size
