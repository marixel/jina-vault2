## 4.2.3: [[Anaerobic]] [[Respiration]]: Fermentation of [[Pyruvate]]

**Review**: [[Glycolysis]] produces 2 [[ATP]], 2 NADH + H2, and 2 [[pyruvate]] molecules.

Fermentation happens when [[glycolysis]] isn't available so that the process can continue; in organisms without mitochondria.
- *[[Glycolysis]] can't continue if [[NAD+]] isn't present.*

In **[[aerobic]]** [[glycolysis]], NADH produced is oxidized to reform NAD for reuse.
In **[[anaerobic]]** [[glycolysis]], fermentation accomplishes the same goal as NAD oxidization in [[aerobic]] [[respiration]] (NADH --> [[NAD+]]).

**Types of fermentation**:
- Alcohol fermentation: [[Pyruvate]] decarboxylated (CO2 leaves) forming acetaldehyde (C2H4O). [[Hydrogen]] atoms from NAD + H+ help convert acetaldehyde to ethanol.
  - Facultative anaerobes: Organisms that can undergo fermentation when without oxygen.
- Lactate fermentation: 2 pyruvates converted to 2 **lactic acid** molecules, forming lactate when ionized. 2 NADH + H+ converted to 2 [[NAD+]] ([[hydrogen]] ionizes lactate).
  - Happens when cells are in oxygen debt (and aren't facultative).

## 4.3.1: [[Aerobic]] [[Respiration]]: The Acetyl CoA Step

[[Aerobic]] [[respiration]] starts after [[pyruvate]] is produced from [[glycolysis]].
It begins with [[pyruvate]] being converted to acetyl CoA (coenzyme A).
1. Decarboxylation (removal of CO2).
2. [[Reduction]] of [[NAD+]] (back to NADH + H+).
3. Attachment of coenzyme A (energizes + destabilizes the molecule; prepares it for [[energy]] release).
In organisms with mitochondria (+ takes place in mitochondria).

Glucose -> [[Pyruvate]] -> Acetyl CoA -> Krebs cycle

## 4.3.2: [[Aerobic]] [[Respiration]]: Krebs Cycle

**Important**
- 8-step cycle where acetyl CoA is added to **oxaloacetate** (which is broken down, producing CO2, **reduced [[coenzymes]]** (NADH + H+ and FADH2), and [[ATP]]).
- Happens to BOTH acetyl CoAs.
1. Acetyl CoA added to oxaloacetate to form citrate (coenzyme A converted to CoA-SH and removed in the process).
2. Dehydration synthesis + hydrolysis during the process; change in shape or isomerization of citrate to form isocitrate (less stability + more [[energy]]).
3. Isocitrate decarboxylated + converted to alpha-ketoglutarate (bc 5 carbons); [[NAD+]] reduced.
4. Alpha-ketoglutarate has CoA added, is decarboxylated, and [[NAD+]] is reduced, converting it to succinyl CoA (4 carbons, less stability).
5. Succinyl CoA releases CoA and makes GTP (which is hydrolyzed), forming succinate and releasing [[ATP]].
6. Succinate converted to fumarate when FAD ([[redox]]-active coenzyme) reduced to form FADH2.
7. Fumarate converted to malate when hydrolyzed.
8. Malate converted to oxaloacetate after [[NAD+]] is reduced.
Oxaloacetate can accept another acetyl CoA, and the process repeats (goes in a loop).

## 4.3.2: [[Glycolysis]] and Krebs Cycle

Net [[energy]] output for one glucose from [[glycolysis]] through [[the Krebs cycle]]: 4 [[ATP]], 10 NADH + H+, and 2 FADH.
[[Glycolysis]]: 2 [[ATP]] investment, 4 [[ATP]] + 2 NADH + H+ payoff.
More [[ATP]] will be produced from *reduced [[coenzymes]]* in mitochondria during **[[electron]] transport chain** and **oxidative [[phosphorylation]]**.

## 4.4.1: [[Electron]] Transport Chain

- [[Energy]] released from [[electrons]] of reduced [[coenzymes]] sets up a *proton gradient* (gradual increase in protons).
- Proteins in the inner mitochondrial membrane can accept [[electrons]] from NADH + H+ and FAD2 to make NAD and FAD (enzyme) and use the lost [[energy]] to pump protons into the intermembrane space.
  - Proteins use [[energy]] lost from [[redox]] reactions to move [[electrons]] from the inner membrane -> intermembrane space (innermost chamber).
- In the **[[electron]] transport chain**, [[electrons]] are transferred between proteins, [[energy]] is released, and free [[energy]] decreases.
  - Above: used to pump protons across the membrane to set up a gradient.
  - The [[electron]] transport chain has proteins that accept [[electrons]] from NADH + H2 and FAD2 to convert them with [[redox]] reactions; [[energy]] released from these reactions pumps [[electrons]] from the inner membrane to the intermembrane space.
    - The final [[electron]] acceptor is oxygen (at the end of the [[electron]] transport chain); because of its high [[electronegativity,]] it can easily accept low-[[energy]] [[electrons]] ([[hydrogen]]). [[Hydrogen]]-oxygen bonds form water.

## 4.4.2: Oxidative [[Phosphorylation]]

- [[ATP]] synthase: protein complex that produces [[ATP]] from the **movement of protons** (H+) down the concentration gradient from the [[electron]] transport chain.
- Chemiosmosis: movement of ions down a gradient; drives the production of [[ATP]].
  - So this is a part of [[ATP]] synthase (because protons are ions).
- Oxidative [[phosphorylation]]: the process of [[ATP]] production driven by [[redox]] reactions that **take place in the [[electron]] transport chain**.
  - See 4.4.1.
- Mitochondrial matrix: surrounded by the inner membrane (mitochondria has a double membrane) and makes up the majority of the organelle's interior.
- **Concentration gradient causes charge imbalance (1 side = charge, other = no charge)**.
  - As protons move down the concentration gradient, [[ATP]] synthase drives [[ATP]] production.

## 4.4.3: [[ATP]] Yield from [[Aerobic]] [[Respiration]]

- **Total yield: 36 [[ATP]]**
- 2 NADH + H converted to FADH2 before reentering the [[electron]] transport chain (in [[glycolysis]], hence 'before').
- Rules (in terms of [[electron]] availability):
  - 2 protons yield 1 [[ATP]].
  - 1 NADH + H+ --> 6 protons get pumped (3 [[ATP]]; 8 NADH + H+ involved).
  - 1 FADH2 ----> 4 protons get pumped (2 [[ATP]]; less than NADH because it enters after NADH; 4 FADH2 involved).
  - An extra 4 [[ATP]] come directly from [[glycolysis]] and [[the Krebs cycle]].

## 4.4.4: Other Fuels in [[Respiration]]

- Fats and proteins are broken down into units that can enter the respiratory pathway and serve as alternative fuel in the process
- [[Respiration]] controlled by **allosteric feedback/inhibition**:
  - Allosteric enzymes stimulated by one thing and inhibited by another.
- Triglycerides (fats) composed of glycerol + 3 fatty acids:
  - Glycerol enters [[glycolysis]] when broken down into *glyceraldehyde phosphate*.
  - Fatty acids broken down into 2-carbon subunits that are easily converted into acetyl CoA (skips straight to Krebs cycle).
  - Fat is almost 2x more [[energy]] efficient than glucose.
- When amino acids have their amine groups removed, processed, and excreted, the amino acid components left over may enter the respiratory pathway.
- Phosphofructokinase (3rd enzyme of [[glycolysis]]) = major control point in [[respiration]]:
  - Substrate binding site and **allosteric site** where molecules can bind to inhibit or stimulate it (allosteric feedback/inhibition).
  - Built-up citrate and/or [[ATP]] can inhibit phosphofructokinase (letting the system know that there is no need to produce more product).
  - As [[ATP]] is used, AMP (phosphofructokinate-stimulating nucleotide) allows for continued production of [[ATP]].

## 4.4.5: The Evolution of [[Glycolysis]]

- [[Glycolysis]] evolved before Krebs cycle and occurs in **all** cells.
- Not dependent on a membrane-bound organelle (because it's in the cytosol).
- Primitive [[glycolysis]] (on an earth with no free oxygen, but a lot of [[hydrogen]] sulfide and iron) *hydrolyzed [[hydrogen]] sulfide* to synthesize [[ATP]]/[[energy]]:
  - Some [[ATP]] formed spontaneously, but most phosphorylated glucose; hydrogenase likely produced H+ from H2 gas (produced from reactions between iron and sulfur compounds, and thus wasn't scarce).
  - [[Hydrogen]] ions from these reactions may have driven the synthesis of [[ATP]] from ADP (so it was only [[glycolysis]]; not as efficient a process as what we know of today, but did produce [[ATP]] nonetheless).
- When oxygen finally entered the atmosphere, organisms suffered in a harsh environment (because they were so used to [[anaerobic]] [[respiration]]) until they became capable of [[aerobic]] [[respiration]] with evolution.

Q: What is anaerobic respiration? 
	A: Anaerobic respiration is fermentation occurring when glycolysis lacks oxygen, allowing the process to continue in organisms without mitochondria.

Q: How is NAD+ involved in glycolysis and anaerobic respiration? 
	A: NAD+ is reduced to NADH + H+ in glycolysis, and in anaerobic respiration, fermentation converts NADH back to NAD+.

Q: What are the types of fermentation, and how do they occur? A: - Alcohol fermentation: Pyruvate is decarboxylated, forming acetaldehyde, converted to ethanol with NADH + H+.
