## 2.1: An Introduction to Atoms
- ### 2.1.1: Atomic Structure: SPONCH and the Atom
	- we can't define life, only describe it
		- to try to understand life, must understand fundamentals
		- [[SPONCH]]:
			- Hydrogen, Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Phosphorus, and Sulfur
			- make up >99% of human body
		- [[atoms]]: smallest units of a chemical element
			- atomic number: number of protons
			- atomic mass: sum of protons and neutrons
			- in atom (not an ion!!) proton number = electron number
- ### 2.1.2: Electrons, Orbitals, and Electron Shells
	- what to understand abt atoms:
		- electrons crucial to bonding
		- atoms = mostly empty space
		- protons attract electrons
	- 7 rules of chemistry (from prof):
		- 1. [[orbital]]s = 2 [[electrons]]
		- 2. orbitals combine to form shells (on outside of atom w/ valence electrons)
		- 3. shell 1 has one orbital (so 2 electrons)
		- 4. shells 2+ = 4 orbitals (8 electrons)
		- 5. **one electron goes in each orbital before any orbital can get a second electron** (confusing; need to study)
		- 6. [[valence layer]]: reactive if not full
		- 7. further [[electrons]]: higher potential energy (bc farther away from nucleus)
- ### 2.1.3: Ions, Ionization, and Isotopes
	- atoms interact at [[valence layer]]
	- [[ion]]: positively/negatively charged particle (atom or molecule)
		- Lewis Dot Notation: shows only [[valence layer]] to help visualize bonding
		- [[ionization]]: formation of [[ion]]s
			- [[atoms]] w/ unfilled [[valence layer]]s will gain or lose electrons to achieve stability
		- [[isotopes]]: same atomic number, different atomic mass (different number of neutrons)
			- [[radioisotope]]: change in element bc neutron charges/becomes proton
- ### 2.1.4: Isotopes: Unraveling Photosynthesis
	- [[isotopes]]: trace paths of [[atoms]] in chemical processes
	- **old** [[Photosynthesis]] equation: $\ce{6CO2 + 6H2O -> C6H12O6 + 6O2}$
		- explanation: water splits during [[Photosynthesis]] to give off O2 (discovered w/ heavy water isotope + equation needs 2 to be rebalanced)
	- **new** [[Photosynthesis]] equation: $\ce{6CO2 + 12H2O -> C6H12O6 + 6O2 + 6H2O}$
		- uses *and* produces water!

## 2.2: Atoms and Bonding
- ### 2.2.1: Bonding and Electronegativity
		- 1. electrons travel in pairs
		- 2. atoms show tendencies towards positive and negative interactions (or [[electrostatics]])
		- 3. tend to establish completely **FULL** outer shells for stability
	- [[electronegativity]]: tendency to gain/hold electrons (numeric value)
		- diff. >2: *transfer* of electrons (ionic bond)
		- diff. <2: *sharing* of electrons (covalent bond)
- ### 2.2.2: Ionic and Covalent Bonds
	- [[ionic]] bonds: 2 oppositely charged ions attract (often 2 highly reactive atoms)
	- [[covalent]] bonds: difference in electronegativity <2 = electron constantly moving between atoms in bond (often involves low-mid reactivity elements)
- ### 2.2.3: Polar Covalent Bonds, Hydrogen Bonds, and Van der Waals Interactions
	- **Polar Covalent Bonds**: one element has shared electrons more often than the other
		- [[the secret to life]] (like water)
	- **Hydrogen Bond**: interactions between 2 molecules where there is a *weak attraction between the partially positive and partially negative atoms* of **both** molecules
		- [[DNA]] constructed of these types of bonds
	- **Van der Waals interaction**: *very weak* attraction between 2 **nonpolar** molecules; very tightly packed molecules necessary
		- caused by charge fluctuations from shift of electron clouds surrounding atoms of involved molecules
## 2.3: Properties of Water
- ### 2.3.1: Water: Hydrogen Bonding, Solubility, and Specific Heat
	- #### properties of water:
		- 1. water = polar
		- 2. water = universal solvent
			- ex. $\ce{Na+Cl-}$ will dissociate in water bc opposite charges wil attract and form [[hydration shells]] (can happen w/ any charged particles)
		- 3. ionic substances will dissociate in water
		- 4. nonpolar substances are insoluble in water
		- 5. water is held together by a *lot* of hydrogen bonds, so requires a lot of energy to overcome attractions
			- [[specific heat]] of water: 1.0 (basis for other substances)
			- resists temp. change
- ### 2.3.2: Water: Adhesion, Cohesion, and a Solid that Floats
	- water is wet (it leaves residue/clings to surfaces bc of polarity)
		- 2 properties:
			- [[adhesion]]: force of attraction between unlike molecules
			- [[cohesion]]: force of attraction between like molecules
		- explain how plants carry water from roots to branches
		- surface tension: no upwards [[cohesive]] force, upper layer molecules tightly packed w/ downwards net force
		- ice floats in water bc between 4C and 0C, it crystallizes and hydrogen bonds become more rigid
		- [[turnover]]: when surface water, reaches 4C, it sinks and warmer water is pushed towards the surface
- ### 2.3.3: Water: Hydrophilic and Hydrophobic Substances
	- hydrophobia: rejection of water (nonpolar molecule)
	- hydrophilic: *will* dissolve in water (polar + ionic molecules)
	- [[detergents]]: molecule able to mix polar and nonpolar molecules bc of versatility (philic + phobic ends able to attract both substances)
- ### 2.3.4: Dissociation of Water and the pH Scale
	- [[pH]] is related to water's polarity
		- when 2 wat
