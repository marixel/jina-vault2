## 2.1: An Introduction to Atoms
- ### 2.1.1: Atomic Structure: SPONCH and the Atom
	- we can't define life, only describe it
		- to try to understand life, must understand fundamentals
		- [[SPONCH]]:
			- Hydrogen, Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Phosphorus, and Sulfur
			- make up >99% of human body
		- [[atoms]]: smallest units of a chemical element
			- atomic number: number of protons
			- atomic mass: sum of protons and neutrons
			- in atom (not an ion!!) proton number = electron number
- ### 2.1.2: Electrons, Orbitals, and Electron Shells
	- what to understand abt atoms:
		- electrons crucial to bonding
		- atoms = mostly empty space
		- protons attract electrons
	- 7 rules of chemistry (from prof):
		- 1. [[orbital]]s = 2 [[electrons]]
		- 2. orbitals combine to form shells (on outside of atom w/ valence electrons)
		- 3. shell 1 has one orbital (so 2 electrons)
		- 4. shells 2+ = 4 orbitals (8 electrons)
		- 5. **one electron goes in each orbital before any orbital can get a second electron** (confusing; need to study)
		- 6. [[valence layer]]: reactive if not full
		- 7. further [[electrons]]: higher potential energy (bc farther away from nucleus)
- ### 2.1.3: Ions, Ionization, and Isotopes
	- atoms interact at [[valence layer]]
	- [[ion]]: positively/negatively charged particle (atom or molecule)
		- Lewis Dot Notation: shows only [[valence layer]] to help visualize bonding
		- [[ionization]]: formation of [[ion]]s
			- [[atoms]] w/ unfilled [[valence layer]]s will gain or lose electrons to achieve stability
		- [[isotopes]]: same atomic number, different atomic mass (different number of neutrons)
			- [[radioisotope]]: change in element bc neutron charges/becomes proton
- ### 2.1.4: Isotopes: Unraveling Photosynthesis
	- [[isotopes]]: trace paths of [[atoms]] in chemical processes
	- **old** [[Photosynthesis]] equation: $\ce{6CO2 + 6H2O -> C6H12O6 + 6O2}$
		- explanation: water splits during [[Photosynthesis]] to give off O2 (discovered w/ heavy water isotope + equation needs 2 to be rebalanced)
	- **new** [[Photosynthesis]] equation: $\ce{6CO2 + 12H2O -> C6H12O6 + 6O2 + 6H2O}$
		- uses *and* produces water!

## 2.2: Atoms and Bonding
- ### 2.2.1: Bonding and Electronegativity
		- 1. electrons travel in pairs
		- 2. atoms show tendencies towards positive and negative interactions (or [[electrostatics]])
		- 3. tend to establish completely **FULL** outer shells for stability
	- [[electronegativity]]: tendency to gain/hold electrons (numeric value)
		- diff. >2: *transfer* of electrons (ionic bond)
		- diff. <2: *sharing* of electrons (covalent bond)
- ### 2.2.2: Ionic and Covalent Bonds
	- [[ionic]] bonds: 2 oppositely charged ions attract (often 2 highly reactive atoms)
	- [[covalent]] bonds: difference in electronegativity <2 = electron constantly moving between atoms in bond (often involves low-mid reactivity elements)
- ### 2.2.3: Polar Covalent Bonds, Hydrogen Bonds, and Van der Waals Interactions
	- **Polar Covalent Bonds**: one element has shared electrons more often than the other
		- [[the secret to life]] (like water)
	- **Hydrogen Bond**: interactions between 2 molecules where there is a *weak attraction between the partially positive and partially negative atoms* of **both** molecules
		- [[DNA]] constructed of these types of bonds
	- **Van der Waals interaction**: *very weak* attraction between 2 **nonpolar** molecules; very tightly packed molecules necessary
		- caused by charge fluctuations from shift of electron clouds surrounding atoms of involved molecules
## 2.3: Properties of Water
- ### 2.3.1: Water: Hydrogen Bonding, Solubility, and Specific Heat
	- #### properties of water:
		- 1. water = polar
		- 2. water = universal solvent
			- ex. $\ce{Na+Cl-}$ will dissociate in water bc opposite charges wil attract and form [[hydration shells]] (can happen w/ any charged particles)
		- 3. ionic substances will dissociate in water
		- 4. nonpolar substances are insoluble in water
		- 5. water is held together by a *lot* of hydrogen bonds, so requires a lot of energy to overcome attractions
			- [[specific heat]] of water: 1.0 (basis for other substances)
			- resists temp. change
- ### 2.3.2: Water: Adhesion, Cohesion, and a Solid that Floats
	- water is wet (it leaves residue/clings to surfaces bc of polarity)
		- 2 properties:
			- [[adhesion]]: force of attraction between unlike molecules
			- [[cohesion]]: force of attraction between like molecules
		- explain how plants carry water from roots to branches
		- surface tension: no upwards [[cohesive]] force, upper layer molecules tightly packed w/ downwards net force
		- ice floats in water bc between 4C and 0C, it crystallizes and hydrogen bonds become more rigid
		- [[turnover]]: when surface water, reaches 4C, it sinks and warmer water is pushed towards the surface
- ### 2.3.3: Water: Hydrophilic and Hydrophobic Substances
	- hydrophobia: rejection of water (nonpolar molecule)
	- hydrophilic: *will* dissolve in water (polar + ionic molecules)
	- [[detergents]]: molecule able to mix polar and nonpolar molecules bc of versatility (philic + phobic ends able to attract both substances)
- ### 2.3.4: Dissociation of Water and the pH Scale
	- [[pH]] is related to water's polarity
		- when 2 water molecules dissociate, $\ce{H3O+}$ (hydronium) and $\ce{-OH}$ (hydroxide) form
		- $\ce{2H2O -> H3O+ + OH-}$ (but only 1/10m per liter of pure water)
		- definition: negative log of concentration of [[hydronium]] of solution (in pure water, $\ce{10^-^7)}$; pH of water = 7
	- [[acid]]s and [[base]]s
		- (1-6.9): acids; proton (H+) donor (pH < 7), adds H+, increasing hydronium concentration
		- (7.1-14): bases; proton (H+) acceptor (pH > 7); removes H+, lowering hydronium concentration
- ### 2.3.5: Hemoglobin as a Buffer
	- [[buffers]] help to maintain a constant pH
	- [[enzymes]] require a constant pH to function
	- [[hemoglobin]] carries oxygen in blood and adds on to substances within to keep pH constant (acid-like hemoglobin/H+Hb)
		- $\ce{CO2 + H2O -> H2CO3 -> H2O + H+ -> H3O+ // HCO^-3}$
		- $\ce{CO2 + H2O -> H2CO3 + K+Hb -> KHCO3 + H+Hb}$
		- if too acidic, buffers accept H+
		- if too basic, buffers release H+

## 2.4: Carbon Chemistry
- ### 2.4.1: Carbon Chemistry and Isomers
	- shape is very important in moelcules
	- most organic molecules involve carbon
		- can form chains by bonding with itself
		- has to have all 4 bonding sites filled (many possibilities)
		- can branch and have single, double, or triple bonds (natural ones usually only have single/double)
		- [[isomer]]: different arrangement, same formula
			- structural: same formula, diff. shape (branching, etc.)
			- geometric: same formula, diff. arrangement around double bond
			- enantiomers: same formula, structures mirror each other
- ### 2.4.2: Functional Side Groups
	- functional side groups: parts of organic molecules w/ their own characteristic properties + most likely to take part in chemical reactions
		- hydroxyl (-OH/alcohols): polarity allows hydrogen bonds
		- carbonyl (aldehydes/ketones): at end of chain; O = C
		- Carboxyl (non-ionized/ionized): always acids (proton donors); polarity allows for ionization; in all organic acids
		- Amino (Non-ionized/ionized): bases; accepts protons; -NH2
			- amino acids: Amino group + carboxyl groups
		- sulfhydryl (thiols/-SH): consist SH; in amino acids, form disulfide bridges (which strengthen protein structure)
		- Phosphate (organic phosphates): derived from phosphoric acid (H3PO4)
			- can be transferred to organic molecules (forming [[phosphorylated-intermediates]])
			- how energy passes from molecule -> molecule in the cell

## 2.5: Carbohydrates
- ### 2.5.1: Carbohydrates: Monosaccharides
	- [[carbohydrates]]: macromolecules w/ hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon involved in structure and energy storage
		- [[monosaccharide]]: simple sugar
			- [[triose sugar]]: 3-carbon sugar
			- [[pentose]]: 5-carbon sugar
			- [[hexose]]: 6-carbon sugar
		- **always twice as much hydrogen as oxygen**
		- sugars usually found in [[cyclic]] form in an organism
		- multiple carbons in a chain = *numbered* for identification in bonding

- ### 2.5.2: Dehydration Synthesis and Hydrolysis: Disaccharides
	- [[disaccharide]]: 2 simple sugars
	- [[glycosidic linkage]]: water removed in reaction between 2 simple sugars ([[dehydration synthesis]]); oxygen glycosidic linkage forms between both monosaccharides
		- [[disaccharide]] forms

- ### 2.5.3: Polysaccharides: Energy Storage Molecules
	- [[polysaccharide]]: 3 or more simple sugars bonded together
		- energy storage molecules
		- chain of [[monosaccharide]]s w/ 1-4 [[glycosidic linkage]]s
		- 3 types of energy storage [[polysaccharide]]s:
			- [[amylose]]: enzyme in saliva that breaks [[glycosidic linkage]]s
				- [[starch]]: generic term for a storage polysaccharide
			- [[amylopectin]]: plant [[polysaccharide]]; 1-4 [[glycosidic linkage]]s and 1-6 branch points
			- [[glycogen]]: more branching than amylopectin, but otherwise similar structure
				- 1-6 [[glycosidic linkage]]s; found in *animals*

- ### 2.5.4: Polysaccharides: Structural Molecules
	- structural polysaccharides:
		- [[cellulose]]: constructs plant cells; 1-4 [[glycosidic linkage]]s
		- [[starch]] vs [[cellulose]]:
			- physical differences:
				- starch: soluble; 1-4 glycosidic links; no [[tensile strength]]; digestible
				- cellulose: insoluble; 1-4 glycosidic links; high [[tensile strength]]; not digestible
			- chemical differences:
			- ![[chemicaldiffs-cellulose-starch.png]]
				- starch: OH positioned "downwards" (right)
				- cellulose: OH positioned "upwards" (left)
			- [[hemicellulose]] and [[pectin]]: hold fibers in plant cell walls
			- [[chitin]]: found in exoskeletons of arthropods and fungi cell walls
			- [[mucopolysaccharides]]: eye fluid, joint lube, skin glue, and umbilical cord

## 2.6: Lipids and Nucleic Acids
- ### 2.6.1: Lipids: An Introduction
	- [[lipid]]s: nonpolar molecules that's insoluble in water and can be used for energy storage
	- 2 types of lipids:
		- [[fats]]: solids at room temperature
		- [[oils]]: liquids at room temperature
	- [[triglycerides]]: [[glycerol]] molecule and 3 fatty acids (which are nonpolar)
		- [[fatty acid]]: long carbon chain with a carboxyl group on the end
		- [[dehydration synthesis]] occurs between each [[fatty acid]] and the [[glycerol]]
		- bonds broken during [[respiration]] (process by which molecular bonds break to use stored energy)

- ### 2.6.2: Saturated vs Unsaturated Fats
	- saturated: all carbons in chain are fully saturated w/ hydrogen
		- created in body
		- usually solid at room temperature
		- ex. peanut butter
	- unsaturated: double bonds, so hydrogen number in chain isn't max
		- *necessary* components of [[cell membrane]]; cannot be produced internally
		- must be obtained through diet
		- more liquid-y than solid at room temperature
		- ex. peanut oil

- ### 2.6.3: Phospholipids, Waxes, and Steroids
	- [[phospholipids]]: basic component of [[cell membrane]] (lipids w/ phosphorus
 ![[phospholipid_structure.png]]
		- very similar to [[triglycerides]]
	- waxes: [[lipid]]s found in cuticle layer of plant leaves preventing water loss; in human's inner ears (earwax)
	- [[steroids]]: composed of 4 fused rings
	- ![[steroid_structure.png]]
		- [[cholesterol]]: component of bile; produces Vitamin D and precursor to formation of sex hormones (ex. testosterone or estrogen)
- ### 2.6.4: Nucleic Acids: An Introduction to Genetic Material
	- #### central Dogma of Biology: DNA makes RNA makes Proteins
		- DNA + RNA
			- made of [[nucleotide]]s
		- *Deoxyribo*nucleic acid: missing an oxygen in ribose
			- nitrogenous bases vary between [[nucleotide]]s (agenine, guanine, cytosine, or *thymine*)
		- *ribo*nucleic acids:
			- nitrogeneous bases also vary (adenine, guanine, cytosine, or *uracil*)
		- purines: adenine and guanine; have 2 rings; *PUGA 2*

## 2.7: Proteins
- ### 2.7.1: Proteins: Amino Acids and the Peptide Bond
	- shape = conformation
	- proteins = polymers of [[amino]] [[acid]]s
	- amino acids: made up of amino group + carboxyl group
	- ![[amino_acid_structure.png]]
		- *source of variation* = R
	- [[peptide]] bond: covalent bond formed between amino acid units by dehydration synthesis
	- w/ above structure, [[polypeptides]] can form

- ### 2.7.2: Amino Acids: The R Group
	- protein properties are determined by amino acid arrangements
	- protein config determined by amino acid interactions
	- electrically charged amino acids:
	- ![[electrically_charged_amino_acids.png]]
		- acidic:
			- aspartic acid
			- glutamic acid
		- basic:
			- lysine
			- arganine
	- polar/hydrophilic amino acids:
	- ![[polar_amino_acids.png]]
		- serine
		- threonine
		- cysteine
		- tyrosine
		- asparagine
		- glutamine

		- alanine
		- valine
		- leucine
		- isoleucine
		- methionine
		- phenylalanine
		- tryptophan
		- proline

- ### 2.7.3: Primary and Secondary Structure
	- proteins do the work of the cell
		- Primary structure 1: order/arrangement of amino acids in peptide
		- ![[primary_structure_protein.png]]
			- RNA instructs order + arrangement of amino acids in a protein, determining its shape
		- Secondary Structure 2: [[hydrogen]] bonds form between adjacents
			- forming an [[alpha helix]] or [[pleated sheet]]
			- ![[alpha_helix_pleated_sheet.png]]
- ### 2.7.4: Tertiary Structure
	- same segment of DNA will always produce same proteins (structurally)
	- involves interactions between [[R groups]]
		- interactions:
			- 1. hydrophobic/nonpolar groups cluster on interior of protein to minimize water contact
			- 2. Van der Waals interactions form between tightly clustered, hydrophobic particles
			- 3. [[ionic]] bonding can occur between oppositely charged groups
			- 4. disulfide bridges: covalent bonds that can take place between 2 cysteine R groups
		- resulting structure will *always* be the same as long as its produced by same type of RNA
	- essentially is a protein's 3D folding into its tertiary structure

- ### 2.7.5: Quaternary Structure
	- some proteins stop at tertiary structure (as polypeptides)
	- quaternary: from interaction of 2 or more polypeptides (ex. hemoglobin
		- hemoglobin: 4 polypeptide chains (iron oxide) interact
	- the results of mutation:
		- protein from given strand of DNA = always the same
		- if DNA changes, protein formation will too (and most likely drastically)
	- protein conformation: protein shape that spontaneously takes place after polypeptide has been released from the RNA that directed its synthesis

- ### 2.7.6: Protein Structure: A Summary
	- 4 levels of protein structure:
		- primary: sequence of amino acid by a peptide bond
		- secondary: hydrogen bonds form between NH and C=O (adjacent segments)
			- either alpha helixes or beta pleated sheets
		- tertiary: interactions between R groups form a set conformation
		- quaternary: polypeptides interact w/ each other to form final conformation
			- mutations will alter formation of proteins
		- SHAPE MATTERS!!!!!!!!!!!!

## 2.8: Enzymes
- ### 2.8.1: Bioenergetics: The Laws of Thermodynamics
	- 2 Laws of [[Thermodynamics]]:
		- 1. Energy can neither be created nor destroyed -- only transferred
		- 2. energy transfer increases entropy (disorder)
			- [[entropy]]: tendency towards disorder
			- **life is a battle against the constantly increasing entropy in the universe**
	- [[free energy]]: the energy available to do [[work]]
		- Free Energy (G) = Total (H) - Temp(T) * Entropy(S)
		- the more organization in a system, the higher its free energy
			- so, free energy in solids > gases bc of stability differences
		- deltaG = G(final) - G(initial)
			- if negative, [[exergonic]] reaction
			- if positive, [[endergonic]] reaction
		- life balances these w/ energy coupling: energy released from exergonic reactions fuel endergonic reactions ([[coupled reactions]])

- ### 2.8.2: Activation Energy
	- [[activation energy]]: the energy required to start a reaciton
	- enzymes *lower* activation energy
  ### 2.8.3: Enzyme Characteristics
	- 1. temperature sensitive (low = slow, high = fast)
		- peak @ certain temp + will stop working past that temperature
	- 2. sensitive to pH (or ions affect enzymes)
	- 3. certain chemicals inhibit enzymes
		- [[inhibitors]] can be *temporary* or *permanent*
	- 4. certain chemicals can promote/enhance enzymes
	- 5. specificity
		- 1 specific enzyme will have a specific substrate (or reactant that enzyme works with, like carbs or proteins)
	- 6. reversible
		- can be involved in synthesis and breakdown reactions

## 2.9: Enzyme Action
- ### 2.9.1: The Induced-Fit model
	- enzymes are:
		- catalysts
		- complex proteins
		- specific to shape
	- induced-fit hypothesis model: model of enzyme action where substrate induces a more complete fit of the enzymes [[active site]] (location in enzyme where [[substrate]] bonds) around it
		- so it adjusts to comfortably integrate enzyme into the structure
	- catalytic cycle:
		- 1. enzyme active site + substrate -> both available
		- 2. induced fit
		- 3. bonds = broken by hydrolysis
		- 4. products are released
		- 5. enzyme is recycled
		- enzyme + substrate -> enzyme-substrate complex -> products + enzymes
	- enzymes stop working bc of denature (loss of protein's conformational shape and function)
	- adding/removing hydrogen moves active site
	- substances improve (cofactors) or lower (inhibitors) protein activity bc of change sin active site
- ### 2.9.2: Enzyme Regulation: Allosteric Regulation
	- regulation can 
- ### 2.9.3: Feedback Inhibition and Cooperativity
