## 2.1: An Introduction to Atoms
- ### 2.1.1: Atomic Structure: SPONCH and the Atom
	- we can't define life, only describe it
		- to try to understand life, must understand fundamentals
		- [[SPONCH]]:
			- Hydrogen, Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Phosphorus, and Sulfur
			- make up >99% of human body
		- [[atoms]]: smallest units of a chemical element
			- atomic number: number of protons
			- atomic mass: sum of protons and neutrons
			- in atom (not an ion!!) proton number = electron number
- ### 2.1.2: Electrons, Orbitals, and Electron Shells
	- what to understand abt atoms:
		- electrons crucial to bonding
		- atoms = mostly empty space
		- protons attract electrons
	- 7 rules of chemistry (from prof):
		- 1. [[orbital]]s = 2 [[electrons]]
		- 2. orbitals combine to form shells (on outside of atom w/ valence electrons)
		- 3. shell 1 has one orbital (so 2 electrons)
		- 4. shells 2+ = 4 orbitals (8 electrons)
		- 5. **one electron goes in each orbital before any orbital can get a second electron** (confusing; need to study)
		- 6. [[valence layer]]: reactive if not full
		- 7. further [[electrons]]: higher potential energy (bc farther away from nucleus)
- ### 2.1.3: Ions, Ionization, and Isotopes
	- atoms interact at [[valence layer]]
	- [[ion]]: positively/negatively charged particle (atom or molecule)
		- Lewis Dot Notation: shows only [[valence layer]] to help visualize bonding
		- [[ionization]]: formation of [[ion]]s
			- [[atoms]] w/ unfilled [[valence layer]]s will gain or lose electrons to achieve stability
		- [[isotopes]]: same atomic number, different atomic mass (different number of neutrons)
			- [[radioisotope]]: change in element bc neutron charges/becomes proton
- ### 2.1.4: Isotopes: Unraveling Photosynthesis
	- [[isotopes]]: trace paths of [[atoms]] in chemical processes
	- **old** [[Photosynthesis]] equation: $\ce{6CO2 + 6H2O -> C6H12O6 + 6O2}$
		- explanation: water splits during [[Photosynthesis]] to give off O2 (discovered w/ heavy water isotope + equation needs 2 to be rebalanced)
	- **new** [[Photosynthesis]] equation: $\ce{6CO2 + 12H2O -> C6H12O6 + 6O2 + 6H2O}$
		- uses *and* produces water!

## 2.2: Atoms and Bonding

	- [[electronegativity]]: tendency to gain/hold electrons (numeric value)
		- diff. >2: *transfer* of electrons (ionic bond)
		- diff. <2: *sharing* of electrons (covalent bond)
- ### 2.2.2: Ionic and Covalent Bonds
	- [[ionic]] bonds: 2 oppositely charged ions attract (often 2 highly reactive atoms)
	- [[covalent]] bonds: difference in electronegativity <2 = electron constantly moving between atoms in bond (often involves low-mid reactivity elements)
- ### 2.2.3: Polar Covalent Bonds, Hydrogen Bonds, and Van der Waals Interactions
	- **Polar Covalent Bonds**: one element has shared electrons more often than the other
		- [[the secret to life]] (like water)
	- **Hydrogen Bond**: interactions between 2 molecules where there is a *weak attraction between the partially positive and partially negative atoms* of **both** molecules
		- [[DNA]] constructed of these types of bonds
	- **Van der Waals interaction**: *very weak* attraction between 2 **nonpolar** molecules; very tightly packed molecules necessary
		- caused by charge fluctuations from shift of electron clouds surrounding atoms of involved molecules
## 2.3: Properties of Water

		- 3. ionic substances will dissociate in water
		- 4. nonpolar substances are insoluble in water
		- 5. water is held together by a *lot* of hydrogen bonds, so requires a lot of energy to overcome attractions

			- [[cohesion]]: force of attraction between like molecules
		- explain how plants carry water from roots to branches
		- surface tension: no upwards [[cohesive]] force, upper layer molecules tightly packed w/ downwards net force
		- ice floats in water bc between 4C and 0C, it crystallizes and hydrogen bonds become more rigid

- ### 2.3.4: Dissociation of Water and the pH Scale
	- [[pH]] is related to water's polarity
		- when 2 water molecules dissociate, $\ce{H3O+}$ (hydronium) and $\ce{-OH}$ (hydroxide) form
		- $\ce{2H2O -> H3O+ + OH-}$ (but only 1/10m per liter of pure water)
		- definition: negative log of concentration of [[hydronium]] of solution (in pure water, $\ce{10^-^7)}$; pH of water = 7
	- [[acid]]s and [[base]]s
		- (1-6.9): acids; proton (H+) donor (pH < 7), adds H+, increasing hydronium concentration
		- (7.1-14): bases; proton (H+) acceptor (pH > 7); removes H+, lowering hydronium concentration
- ### 2.3.5: Hemoglobin as a Buffer
	- [[buffers]] help to maintain a constant pH
	- [[enzymes]] require a constant pH to function
	- [[hemoglobin]] carries oxygen in blood and adds on to substances within to keep pH constant (acid-like hemoglobin/H+Hb)
		- $\ce{CO2 + H2O -> H2CO3 -> H2O + H+ -> H3O+ // HCO^-3}$
		- $\ce{CO2 + H2O -> H2CO3 + K+Hb -> KHCO3 + H+Hb}$
		- if too acidic, buffers accept H+
		- if too basic, buffers release H+

			- enantiomers: same formula, structures mirror each other
- ### 2.4.2: Functional Side Groups
	- functional side groups: parts of organic molecules w/ their own characteristic properties + most likely to take part in chemical reactions
		- hydroxyl (-OH/alcohols): polarity allows hydrogen bonds
		- carbonyl (aldehydes/ketones): at end of chain; O = C
		- Carboxyl (non-ionized/ionized): always acids (proton donors); polarity allows for ionization; in all organic acids
		- Amino (Non-ionized/ionized): bases; accepts protons; -NH2

- ### 2.6.2: Saturated vs Unsaturated Fats
	- saturated: all carbons in chain are fully saturated w/ hydrogen
		- created in body
		- usually solid at room temperature
		- ex. peanut butter
	- unsaturated: double bonds, so hydrogen number in chain isn't max
		- *necessary* components of [[cell membrane]]; cannot be produced internally

		- Secondary Structure 2: [[hydrogen]] bonds form between adjacents
			- forming an [[alpha helix]] or [[pleated sheet]]
			- ![[alpha_helix_pleated_sheet.png]]
- ### 2.7.4: Tertiary Structure
	- same segment of DNA will always produce same proteins (structurally)
	- involves interactions between [[R groups]]
		- interactions:
			- 1. hydrophobic/nonpolar groups cluster on interior of protein to minimize water contact
			- 2. Van der Waals interactions form between tightly clustered, hydrophobic particles
			- 3. [[ionic]] bonding can occur between oppositely charged groups
			- 4. disulfide bridges: covalent bonds that can take place between 2 cysteine R groups
		- resulting structure will *always* be the same as long as its produced by same type of RNA
	- essentially is a protein's 3D folding into its tertiary structure

- ### 2.7.5: Quaternary Structure
	- some proteins stop at tertiary structure (as polypeptides)
	- quaternary: from interaction of 2 or more polypeptides (ex. hemoglobin
		- hemoglobin: 4 polypeptide chains (iron oxide) interact
	- the results of mutation:
		- protein from given strand of DNA = always the same
		- if DNA changes, protein formation will too (and most likely drastically)
	- protein conformation: protein shape that spontaneously takes place after polypeptide has been released from the RNA that directed its synthesis

## 2.8: Enzymes
- ### 2.8.1: Bioenergetics: The Laws of Thermodynamics
	- 2 Laws of [[Thermodynamics]]:
		- 1. Energy can neither be created nor destroyed -- only transferred
		- 2. energy transfer increases entropy (disorder)
			- [[entropy]]: tendency towards disorder
			- **life is a battle against the constantly increasing entropy in the universe**
	- [[free energy]]: the energy available to do [[work]]
		- Free Energy (G) = Total (H) - Temp(T) * Entropy(S)
		- the more organization in a system, the higher its free energy
			- so, free energy in solids > gases bc of stability differences
		- deltaG = G(final) - G(initial)
			- if negative, [[exergonic]] reaction
			- if positive, [[endergonic]] reaction
		- life balances these w/ energy coupling: energy released from exergonic reactions fuel endergonic reactions ([[coupled reactions]])

- ### 2.8.2: Activation Energy

## 2.9: Enzyme Action
- ### 2.9.1: The Induced-Fit model
	- enzymes are:
		- catalysts
		- complex proteins
		- specific to shape
	- induced-fit hypothesis model: model of enzyme action where substrate induces a more complete fit of the enzymes [[active site]] (location in enzyme where [[substrate]] bonds) around it
		- so it adjusts to comfortably integrate enzyme into the structure
	- catalytic cycle:
		- 1. enzyme active site + substrate -> both available
		- 2. induced fit
		- 3. bonds = broken by hydrolysis
		- 4. products are released
		- 5. enzyme is recycled
		- enzyme + substrate -> enzyme-substrate complex -> products + enzymes
	- enzymes stop working bc of denature (loss of protein's conformational shape and function)
	- adding/removing hydrogen moves active site
	- substances improve (cofactors) or lower (inhibitors) protein activity bc of change sin active site
- ### 2.9.2: Enzyme Regulation: Allosteric Regulation
	- regulation can control enzyme activity, but it's ineffective
		- but, enzymes must be regulated to produce desired outcome
		- types:
			- allosteric control: 2 or more subunits; substances bonded will render it active (activator) or inactive (inhibitor)
			- ![[allosteric_enzymes.png]]
				- example: 
				- ![[allosteric_enzymes_atp_example.png]]
				- catabolic enzymes (break down cells + release ATP/energy)
				- energy levels in ATP decrease + its name changes
- ### 2.9.3: Feedback Inhibition and Cooperativity
	- [[feedback inhibition]]: enzyme regulation involving inhibition of enzyme in [[metabolic pathways]] (singular) by an end product of that pathway
		- ![[Pasted image 20230813045734.png]]
		- if D inhibits enzyme x, it can conserve enzyme (feedback)
			- can also be negative (view TW notes)
		- [[cooperativity]]: substrate itself activates (and regulates) enzyme
		-
