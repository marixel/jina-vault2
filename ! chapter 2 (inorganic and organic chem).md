## 2.1: An Introduction to Atoms
- ### 2.1.1: Atomic Structure: SPONCH and the Atom
	- we can't define life, only describe it
		- to try to understand life, must understand fundamentals
		- [[SPONCH]]:
			- Hydrogen, Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Phosphorus, and Sulfur
			- make up >99% of human body
		- [[atoms]]: smallest units of a chemical element
			- atomic number: number of protons
			- atomic mass: sum of protons and neutrons
			- in atom (not an ion!!) proton number = electron number
- ### 2.1.2: Electrons, Orbitals, and Electron Shells
	- what to understand abt atoms:
		- electrons crucial to bonding
		- atoms = mostly empty space
		- protons attract electrons
	- 7 rules of chemistry (from prof):
		- 1. [[orbital]]s = 2 [[electrons]]
		- 2. orbitals combine to form shells (on outside of atom w/ valence electrons)
		- 3. shell 1 has one orbital (so 2 electrons)
		- 4. shells 2+ = 4 orbitals (8 electrons)
		- 5. **one electron goes in each orbital before any orbital can get a second electron** (confusing; need to study)
		- 6. [[valence layer]]: reactive if not full
		- 7. further [[electrons]]: higher potential energy (bc farther away from nucleus)
- ### 2.1.3: Ions, Ionization, and Isotopes
	- atoms interact at [[valence layer]]
	- [[ion]]: positively/negatively charged particle (atom or molecule)
		- Lewis Dot Notation: shows only [[valence layer]] to help visualize bonding
		- [[ionization]]: formation of [[ion]]s
			- [[atoms]] w/ unfilled [[valence layer]]s will gain or lose electrons to achieve stability
		- [[isotopes]]: same atomic number, different atomic mass (different number of neutrons)
			- [[radioisotope]]: change in element bc neutron charges/becomes proton
- ### 2.1.4: Isotopes: Unraveling Photosynthesis
	- [[isotopes]]: trace paths of [[atoms]] in chemical processes
	- **old** [[Photosynthesis]] equation: $\ce{6CO2 + 6H2O -> C6H12O6 + 6O2}$
		- explanation: water splits during [[Photosynthesis]] to give off O2 (discovered w/ heavy water isotope + equation needs 2 to be rebalanced)
	- **new** [[Photosynthesis]] equation: $\ce{6Co2 + 12H2O -> }$
