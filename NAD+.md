- a usually-[[ionized]] [[coenzyme]] that carries [[electrons]] (or undergoes [[reduction]]) to gradually release energy in a redox reaction
- dinucleotide/building block of DNA
- [[nicotinamide]]: derived from vitamin B
	- nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ([[NAD+]])
- [[dehydrogenase]]:  enzymes that transfer [[hydrogen]] atoms from food molecules to [[NAD+]]

an agent of [[oxidation]] (meaning it donates an  electron and is reduced)
#### reduced form: $\ce{NADH + H+}$
- via [[dehydrogenase]], [[electrons]] in [[hydrogen]] are transferred to ionized NAD+ (positive bc it can accept [[electrons]]/[[valence layer]] isn't full)
