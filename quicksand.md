Nella Larsen

### main ideas (as seen in introduction):
- the relations between the [[black community]] and the [[white society]]
- the assimilation/survival of a black individual in an almost entirely white society
- the expression of sex between black women and white or black men (any man available/attractive)
	- is this referring to attractiveness from the man’s perspective, or from the woman’s?

the black experience has often been described as a threefold stage of development (as stated in book):
- africa
- slavery
- northern ghettos
	however, this is confinement; they have always lived beyond these confines
what was the [[harlem]] renaissance?
- the prominence of black novelists has been going down
- black, novelist women often wrote about assimilation into a white man’s society
	- even in this age, black women were often sexualized and media involving them portrayed them as such (affairs, wedlock, [[mulattoes]] and [[quadrooons]])
[[human tragedies]] vs [[sociological tragedies]]
note the similarities between Nella’s (introduction) and Helga’s (novel) experiences as black women in a white-focused world; in what ways are they similar? what differences are there?
- if helga’s experiences closely mirror nella’s, how do they give otherwise unrecognized insight as to what black women had to endure both in the usa and throughout much of the world?
nella vanished after the publication of her second novel, supposedly moving, taking back up her old career, and dying quietly. (bc of a controversy involving one of her stories and claims of plagiarism)

- #### chapter 1
	- helga = schoolteacher
	- white preacher said that ‘good taste’ among black people is equivalent to them ‘staying in their places’
		- helga dislikes this preacher and his ‘patronizing, insulting’ remarks
	- she ‘resents’ where she is in life right now, physically and otherwise. in her time away from work, she isolates herself in a dark room and reads, trying to take her mind away from the burdens of the day; still, she wants to get away
