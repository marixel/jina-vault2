Nella Larsen

**takes place in harlem

### main ideas (as seen in introduction):
- the relations between the [[black community]] and the [[white society]]
- the assimilation/survival of a black individual in an almost entirely white society
- the expression of sex between black women and white or black men (any man available/attractive)
	- is this referring to attractiveness from the man’s perspective, or from the woman’s?

the black experience has often been described as a threefold stage of development (as stated in book):
- africa
- slavery
- northern ghettos
	however, this is confinement; they have always lived beyond these confines
what was the [[harlem]] renaissance?
- the prominence of black novelists has been going down
- black, novelist women often wrote about assimilation into a white man’s society
	- even in this age, black women were often sexualized and media involving them portrayed them as such (affairs, wedlock, [[mulattoes]] and [[quadrooons]])
[[human tragedies]] vs [[sociological tragedies]]
note the similarities between Nella’s (introduction) and Helga’s (novel) experiences as black women in a white-focused world; in what ways are they similar? what differences are there?
- **if helga’s experiences closely mirror nella’s, how do they give otherwise unrecognized insight as to what black women had to endure both in the usa and throughout much of the world?**
nella vanished after the publication of her second novel, supposedly moving, taking back up her old career, and dying quietly. (bc of a controversy involving one of her stories and claims of plagiarism)

- #### chapter 1
	- helga = schoolteacher
	- white preacher said that ‘good taste’ among black people is equivalent to them ‘staying in their places’
		- helga dislikes this preacher and his ‘patronizing, insulting’ remarks
	- she ‘resents’ where she is in life right now, physically and otherwise. in her time away from work, she isolates herself in a dark room and reads, trying to take her mind away from the burdens of the day; still, she wants to get away
		- still, in the end, she reluctantly embraces her fate with a smile as part of her routine before going to bed, her room messy (though it usually isn't! she's undergoing a change in her character)
