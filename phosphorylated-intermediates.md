### [[ATP]]
	triphosphorylated nucleotide

#### How does the cell capture and process the energy released by the [[high-energy bonds]] in ATP?

#### How does a cell make [[ATP]]?

### Phosphorylated Intermediates:

- ##### involve [[coupled reactions]] between the energy released by the [[hydrolosis]] of [[ATP]] and an [[endergonic]] reaction 
	- [[spontaneous]] and [[exergonic]] process bc coupling = surplus of energy (see +(P) in formula)
	- [[phosphorylation]]
	- $\ce{ATP -> ADP + (P)}$
- ### lose [[phosphate group]] during a coupled reaction

#### *ATP is not a phosphorylated intermediate; it forms them with other molecules*
