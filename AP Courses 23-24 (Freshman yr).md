## ap gov:
- prep book:
- textbook: openstax us government (chapters ——)
- need to *understand* more than *memorize* (so zettelkasten should work pretty well)
	- memorization will mostly have to do with scotus cases and founding docs
	- read + watch the daily news and try to connect what you’re learning (so political news! dad should be a big help w this :D)
	- can also listen to podcasts (that you’re interested in! can use these for study sessions to make ‘em more interesting)
	- can also talk to dad at dinner abt these
- adam norris’ + heimer’s history review videos
- ‘cram, day-before-exam’ videos
- course-exam description (what to focus on)
- make sure to practice writing essays (every few weeks or so)
	- may want to email ap gov teachers at conway high for frq’s? and can use college board frq’s
	- doesn’t need to be ‘eloquent’ as long as it **gets the point across!!!! be! concise! jina! please! do! not! mess! this! up!**

## ap psych
- prep book: 
- textbook(?)
- will need to know psychologists, methods, diagrams, other vocab
- crash course for review + in conjunction with something else (has hank and john green??? i did not know that?? oh my gosh????
- take practice tests after every unit + mix in some past unit questions as you continue (if you feel like it)
- multiple choice sections will be heavily dependent on vocabulary
- time yourself while practicing!!! big problem i have
	- also: when doing frqs, find rubrics and grade yourself (if wrong, highlight terms and rewrite/recall definitions)
- cram session day before exam

## ap lang
- prep book:
- textbook: 
- multiple choice questions are very similar to sat questions (just harder)
	- if a question references a line/paragraph, mark that line/passage with the question number (to remind yourself to answer it)
	- when taking practice tests, check the *type* of question that you’re getting wrong! then focus on these types and go back
- ***rhetorical and literary devices are very, very, very important!!! you need to know them in and out. be able to recognize and apply them!!!!!***
	- so write definitions, but **focus** on examples (to recognize them in practice)
- keep argument essay last (bc you don’t need outside resources)
- essays:
	- argument (keep last bc you don’t need outside resources)
		- make an **info bank** before exam (extensive document w/ as much outside knowledge that can be applied to any prompt, like recently read books, current events, movies, documentaries, other classes, etc.)
	- synthesis (use outside information alongside documents)
		- documents should not be *providing* your arguments; rather, you need to form **your own** arguments
	- rhetorical analysis (lots, LOTS of practice!)
		- maybe make lists of rhetorical devices you find in passages of past ap tests so that you know what to expect? (see how they’re important to the author’s message!) 
	- need to learn **how to synthesize information** without drowning yourself out with evidence

## apes

- remember to *practice applications* of concepts
- jordan dischinger-swedes’ youtube channel will be very helpful

	- make sure that you’re correctly recalling and applying the content (by going back and checking what you got wrong/viewing rubrics if available)
- make sure to time yourself!

## ap calc
- apply formulas (make sure to regularly review tbhstudying’s calc bc video for a list)
	- know when and how to derive them by studying different types of problems in one set (not just one unit at a time)
- be able to graph integrals, derivatives, and logarithms on your calculator’
- show **every single** part of your work (to get partial credit/find your mistakes)
