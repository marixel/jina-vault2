review questions 2, 9, 18, 24, and 25 on chapter test for midterm/final (got wrong on first attempt)

## 4.1: An Introduction to Respiration
- ### 4.1.1: ATP Structure and Function
	- [[the secret to life]]
	- **how does a cell do work?**
	- ### **[[ATP]]**
	- 3 phosphate groups
	![[ATP structure vs nucleotide structure.png]]
	#### 3x as many [[phosphate group]]s as a [[nucleotide]]
	- 3rd phosphate bond: [[high-energy bonds]] (singular)
		- when energy is released from a reaction, that reaction has a negative change in free energy (bc products more stable than reactants)
		- phosphate bond in ATP = not very stable bc negative charges on phosphate group repel each other
- ### 4.1.2: Phosphorylated Intermediates
	[[ATP]]
	- triphosphorylated nucleotide
	
	How does the cell capture and process the energy released by the [[high-energy bonds]] in ATP?
	
	How does a cell make [[ATP]]?
	
	Phosphorylated Intermediates:
	
	- involve [[coupled reactions]] between the energy released by the [[hydrolysis]] of [[ATP]] and an [[endergonic]] reaction 
		- [[spontaneous]] and [[exergonic]] process bc coupling = surplus of energy (see +(P) in formula)
		- [[phosphorylation]]
		- $\ce{ATP -> ADP + (P)}$
	- lose [[phosphate group]] during a coupled reaction
	
	- *ATP is not a phosphorylated intermediate; it forms them with other molecules*
- ### 4.1.3: Respiration: An Overview
		- ### the process in which [[ATP]] is generated from the breakdown of organic molecules
	
	### goal: transfer of energy stored in bonds of large, complex molecules to [[ATP]]
	
	### steps (generally):
	1. [[glycolysis]]: happens to ***all*** cells; glucose broken down by enzymes to release energy (inducing [[spontaneous]] reaction) to make ATP
		- broken down into [[pyruvate]] ($\ce{C6H12O6 -> (2)3C Pyruvate}$)
	- #### [[anaerobic]] [[respiration]] stops at first step of [[glycolysis]]
	- #### [[aerobic]] [[respiration]] will continue to step 10 of [[glycolysis]]
- ### 4.1.4: Redox: A Brief Overview
	- redox/oxidation-reduction reactions involve transfer of electrons between molecules
		- oxidation = loss of electrons
		- reduction = gain of electrons
		- always happen together (hence nickname 'redox')
		- example:
			- ![[Pasted image 20230813081042.png]]
			- water and CO2 result
			- methane's carbon = 4 hydrogen atoms --> 2 oxygen atoms (oxygen = more electronegative than hydrogen)
				- carbon will lose electrons when bonded to oxygen (bc oxygen pulling it away w/ stronger force than hydrogen did)
				- carbon is then oxidized
	- energy = product of redox reactions bc electrons go from low --> high electronegativity
		- [[electronegativity]]: molecule's ability to hold electrons
		- energy released when something goes from high --> lower state of potential energy
- ### 4.1.5: Energy Release from Sugar: A Demo
	- energy stored between bonds of sugar = released when chemical source of oxygen (potassium chlorate) is added (and activated by activation energy (sulfuric acid))
	- to prevent rapid, exergonic reactions like this from happening (and destroying our insides) our body has developed a method to regulate the energy release from sugar
- ### 4.1.6: Coenzymes: The Role of NAD+
	- energy release = regulated in cell by a series of redox reactions with enzymes and coenzymes
		- in [[metabolic pathways]] of cell through transfer of electrons
	- NAD = nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
		- coenzyme involved in redox reactions of respiration
	- [[dehydrogenase]]: enzyme able to transfer hydrogen atoms from food molecules to NAD+

## 4.2: Glycolysis and Fermentation
- ### 4.2.1: Glycolysis: The Initial Steps: Energy Input
	- part 1: [[energy]]/[[ATP]] investment stage
	1.  [[ATP]] to [[ADP]] when [[phosphate group]] invested
		- [[hydrogen]] electrons transferred into phosphate with help of the [[enzyme]] ****[[hexokinase]]** (carbon-6 [[energy]] investment/[[glucose]])
		- glucose —> glucose 6-phosphate
	2. glucose 6-phosphate isomerized into [[fructose]] with [[enzyme]] **isomerase**
		- fructose 6-phosphate forms
	3. fructose 6-phosphate undergoes [[phosphorylation]] to form fructose 16-biphosphate (“bi” bc [[ATP]] invested again)
	4. new [[ATP]] investment broken down into [[ADP]]; another phosphate group added with enzyme **phosphofructokinase** (having to do with high energy and [[phosphate group]]s)
		- 6-carbon, biphosphorylated substance
	5. fructose biphosphate broken down into two components:
		- [[dehydroxyacetone phosphate]] (pretty useless for the cell when not converted)
			- unconverted: 3-carbon substance (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate)
			- finishes glycolysis + respiration
			- enzyme __ converts glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate into dehydroxyacetone phosphate, which can be used by cell
			- state of [[equilibrium]] established
				- when G3P put into rest of [[glycolysis]], [[dehydroxyacetone phosphate]] moves in direction of G3P until it’s all converted to G3P

disorganized info: during [[glycolysis]], [[hydrogen]] is removed and (something else) is undergoing [[reduction]]

first stage summary:
- glucose doubly phosphorylated, split into 2 parts, first of which splits into 3-carbon molecule
- ### 4.2.2: Glycolysis: The Energy Payoff
- ### 4.2.3: [[Anaerobic]] [[Respiration]]: Fermentation of [[Pyruvate]]
	**Review**: [[Glycolysis]] produces 2 [[ATP]], 2 NADH + H2, and 2 [[pyruvate]] molecules.
	
	Fermentation happens when [[glycolysis]] isn't available so that the process can continue; in organisms without mitochondria.
	- *[[Glycolysis]] can't continue if [[NAD+]] isn't present.*
	
	In **[[aerobic]]** [[glycolysis]], NADH produced is oxidized to reform NAD for reuse.
	In **[[anaerobic]]** [[glycolysis]], fermentation accomplishes the same goal as NAD oxidization in [[aerobic]] [[respiration]] (NADH --> [[NAD+]]).
	
	**Types of fermentation**:
	- Alcohol fermentation: [[Pyruvate]] decarboxylated (CO2 leaves) forming acetaldehyde (C2H4O). [[Hydrogen]] atoms from NAD + H+ help convert acetaldehyde to ethanol.
	  - Facultative anaerobes: Organisms that can undergo fermentation when without oxygen.
	- Lactate fermentation: 2 pyruvates converted to 2 **lactic acid** molecules, forming lactate when ionized. 2 NADH + H+ converted to 2 [[NAD+]] ([[hydrogen]] ionizes lactate).
	  - Happens when cells are in oxygen debt (and aren't facultative).
## 4.3: Aerobic Respiration
- ### 4.3.1: [[Aerobic]] [[Respiration]]: The Acetyl CoA Step

[[Aerobic]] [[respiration]] starts after [[pyruvate]] is produced from [[glycolysis]].
It begins with [[pyruvate]] being converted to acetyl CoA (coenzyme A).
1. Decarboxylation (removal of CO2).
2. [[Reduction]] of [[NAD+]] (back to NADH + H+).
3. Attachment of coenzyme A (energizes + destabilizes the molecule; prepares it for [[energy]] release).
In organisms with mitochondria (+ takes place in mitochondria).

Glucose -> [[Pyruvate]] -> Acetyl CoA -> Krebs cycle

- ### 4.3.2: [[Aerobic]] [[Respiration]]: Krebs Cycle
**Important**
- 8-step cycle where acetyl CoA is added to **oxaloacetate** (which is broken down, producing CO2, **reduced [[coenzymes]]** (NADH + H+ and FADH2), and [[ATP]]).
- Happens to BOTH acetyl CoAs.
1. Acetyl CoA added to oxaloacetate to form citrate (coenzyme A converted to CoA-SH and removed in the process).
2. Dehydration synthesis + hydrolysis during the process; change in shape or isomerization of citrate to form isocitrate (less stability + more [[energy]]).
3. Isocitrate decarboxylated + converted to alpha-ketoglutarate (bc 5 carbons); [[NAD+]] reduced.
4. Alpha-ketoglutarate has CoA added, is decarboxylated, and [[NAD+]] is reduced, converting it to succinyl CoA (4 carbons, less stability).
5. Succinyl CoA releases CoA and makes GTP (which is hydrolyzed), forming succinate and releasing [[ATP]].
6. Succinate converted to fumarate when FAD ([[redox]]-active coenzyme) reduced to form FADH2.
7. Fumarate converted to malate when hydrolyzed.
8. Malate converted to oxaloacetate after [[NAD+]] is reduced.
Oxaloacetate can accept another acetyl CoA, and the process repeats (goes in a loop).

- ### 4.3.3: [[Glycolysis]] and the Krebs Cycle
- Net [[energy]] output for one glucose from [[glycolysis]] through [[the Krebs cycle]]: 4 [[ATP]], 10 NADH + H+, and 2 FADH.
- [[Glycolysis]]: 2 [[ATP]] investment, 4 [[ATP]] + 2 NADH + H+ payoff.
- More [[ATP]] will be produced from *reduced [[coenzymes]]* in mitochondria during **[[electron]] transport chain** and **oxidative [[phosphorylation]]**.
## 4.4: The Electron Transport Chain and Oxidative Phosphorylation
- ### 4.4.1: [[Electron]] Transport Chain

	- [[Energy]] released from [[electrons]] of reduced [[coenzymes]] sets up a *proton gradient* (gradual increase in protons).
	- Proteins in the inner mitochondrial membrane can accept [[electrons]] from NADH + H+ and FAD2 to make NAD and FAD (enzyme) and use the lost [[energy]] to pump protons into the intermembrane space.
	  - Proteins use [[energy]] lost from [[redox]] reactions to move [[electrons]] from the inner membrane -> intermembrane space (innermost chamber).
	- In the **[[electron]] transport chain**, [[electrons]] are transferred between proteins, [[energy]] is released, and free [[energy]] decreases.
	  - Above: used to pump protons across the membrane to set up a gradient.
	  - The [[electron]] transport chain has proteins that accept [[electrons]] from NADH + H2 and FAD2 to convert them with [[redox]] reactions; [[energy]] released from these reactions pumps [[electrons]] from the inner membrane to the intermembrane space.
	    - The final [[electron]] acceptor is oxygen (at the end of the [[electron]] transport chain); because of its high [[electronegativity]] it can easily accept low-[[energy]] [[electrons]] ([[hydrogen]]). [[Hydrogen]]-oxygen bonds form water.
- ### 4.4.2: Oxidative [[Phosphorylation]]

	- [[ATP]] synthase: protein complex that produces [[ATP]] from the **movement of protons** (H+) down the concentration gradient from the [[electron]] transport chain.
	- Chemiosmosis: movement of ions down a gradient; drives the production of [[ATP]].
	  - So this is a part of [[ATP]] synthase (because protons are ions).
	- Oxidative [[phosphorylation]]: the process of [[ATP]] production driven by [[redox]] reactions that **take place in the [[electron]] transport chain**.
	  - See 4.4.1.
	- Mitochondrial matrix: surrounded by the inner membrane (mitochondria has a double membrane) and makes up the majority of the organelle's interior.
	- **Concentration gradient causes charge imbalance (1 side = charge, other = no charge)**.
	  - As protons move down the concentration gradient, [[ATP]] synthase drives [[ATP]] production.
- ### 4.4.3: [[ATP]] Yield from [[Aerobic]] [[Respiration]]

	- **Total yield: 36 [[ATP]]**
	- 2 NADH + H converted to FADH2 before reentering the [[electron]] transport chain (in [[glycolysis]], hence 'before').
	- Rules (in terms of [[electron]] availability):
	  - 2 protons yield 1 [[ATP]].
	  - 1 NADH + H+ --> 6 protons get pumped (3 [[ATP]]; 8 NADH + H+ involved).
	  - 1 FADH2 ----> 4 protons get pumped (2 [[ATP]]; less than NADH because it enters after NADH; 4 FADH2 involved).
	  - An extra 4 [[ATP]] come directly from [[glycolysis]] and [[the Krebs cycle]].
- ### 4.4.4: Other Fuels in [[Respiration]]

	- Fats and proteins are broken down into units that can enter the respiratory pathway and serve as alternative fuel in the process
	- [[Respiration]] controlled by **allosteric feedback/inhibition**:
	  - Allosteric enzymes stimulated by one thing and inhibited by another.
	- Triglycerides (fats) composed of glycerol + 3 fatty acids:
	  - Glycerol enters [[glycolysis]] when broken down into *glyceraldehyde phosphate*.
	  - Fatty acids broken down into 2-carbon subunits that are easily converted into acetyl CoA (skips straight to Krebs cycle).
	  - Fat is almost 2x more [[energy]] efficient than glucose.
	- When amino acids have their amine groups removed, processed, and excreted, the amino acid components left over may enter the respiratory pathway.
	- Phosphofructokinase (3rd enzyme of [[glycolysis]]) = major control point in [[respiration]]:
	  - Substrate binding site and **allosteric site** where molecules can bind to inhibit or stimulate it (allosteric feedback/inhibition).
	  - Built-up citrate and/or [[ATP]] can inhibit phosphofructokinase (letting the system know that there is no need to produce more product).
	  - As [[ATP]] is used, AMP (phosphofructokinate-stimulating nucleotide) allows for continued production of [[ATP]].
### 4.4.5: The Evolution of [[Glycolysis]]

- [[Glycolysis]] evolved before Krebs cycle and occurs in **all** cells.
- Not dependent on a membrane-bound organelle (because it's in the cytosol).
- Primitive [[glycolysis]] (on an earth with no free oxygen, but a lot of [[hydrogen]] sulfide and iron) *hydrolyzed [[hydrogen]] sulfide* to synthesize [[ATP]]/[[energy]]:
  - Some [[ATP]] formed spontaneously, but most phosphorylated glucose; hydrogenase likely produced H+ from H2 gas (produced from reactions between iron and sulfur compounds, and thus wasn't scarce).
  - [[Hydrogen]] ions from these reactions may have driven the synthesis of [[ATP]] from ADP (so it was only [[glycolysis]]; not as efficient a process as what we know of today, but did produce [[ATP]] nonetheless).
- When oxygen finally entered the atmosphere, organisms suffered in a harsh environment (because they were so used to [[anaerobic]] [[respiration]]) until they became capable of [[aerobic]] [[respiration]] with evolution.
