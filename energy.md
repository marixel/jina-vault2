- stored in the bonds of a molecule
- released when compounds/molecules are broken down
- substances in body must undergo [[regulation]] by the body to avoid highly reactive reactions (as the addition of [[activation energy]] will likely cause a sudden [[spontaneous]] [[oxidation]] reaction)
	- in our cells, this [[energy]] is released **gradually**
		- #### how this happens:
			1. on a series of 'steps,' some [[energy]] is released at each step
			2. this release is managed by [[coenzymes]] ([[NAD+]])
