## 6.1: Discovering DNA
- ### 6.1.1: Molecular Genetics: the Protein vs. DNA Debate
	- [[Gregor Mendel]]: described factors that were responsible for passing traits on; didn't know what the factors were
	- coordinated scientific effort to identity genetic material = mid-1800s to mid-1900s
		- at beginning, researchers formalized qualities that the unknown genetic material must possess; 4 qualities:
			- 1. information
				- must store relatively large amt of info, enough to produce cell's [[proteins]] and other structures (bc DNA makes RNA makes proteins)
			- 2. replication
			- 3. communication
			- 4. change
		- **these 4 qualities make up the "brain" of the cell**
	- during 1800s and early 1900s, [[Friedrich Miescher]], [[Robert Feulgen]], and [[Archibald Edward Garrod]] contributed to understanding of the genetic material
		- [[Friedrich Miescher]]: extracted an acidic material from white blood cells' nuclei, calling it [[nucleic acid]]
			- #### type of [[nucleic acid]] found in chromosomes of all [[eukaryotic]] cells: [[DNA]]
			- later, was determined that [[nucleic acid]]s are made up of 4 [[nucleotide]]s: adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine
			- ![[Pasted image 20230816080801.png]]
		- [[Robert Feulgen]]: developed staining technique that could *quantify* DNA; the more DNA present in the nuclei, the darker the stain
		- ![[Pasted image 20230816081940.png]]
			- w/ this, researchers found that **DNA levels are species-specific**
			- across all species, sex cells consistently contained *half* the amount of DNA that the [[autosomal]]/unrelated to sex cells did
		- during this time, most scientists thought that [[protein]] (not [[DNA]]) was genetic material (even w/ evidence)

- ### 6.1.2: Continuing to Link Genes to Chemicals: Muller, Beadle, and Tatum
	- in 1920s: Hermann Muller and Thomas Hunt Morgan furthered genetics field
		- Muller: could increase mutation rate in fruit flies by subjecting them to x-rays
		- ![[Pasted image 20230816082422.png]]
			- 10C increase in temp = doubled mutation rate
	- George Beadle and Edward Tatum: subject red bread mold to x-rays, **greatly increasing mutation rate**
	- ![[Pasted image 20230816082431.png]]
		- normally mold can synthesize almost all of the organic compounds it needs + can be grown on [[minimal medium]] containing a few minerals, 1 vitamin, and an energy src
		- work:
			- 1. spores subjected to x-rays; placed on enriched media containing amino acids and allowed to grow until they produce spores that're collected
			- 2. spores crown on [[minimal media]]; if they can't, then a mutation has occurred bc of x-rays
			- 3. pieces of mutant mold = put in tubes containing minimal media +1 amino acid each; mutant strain can only grow when amino acid [[alanine]] present in tube
			- result indicated that mutation could be linked to defect in specific enzyme (genes + enzymes linked); "one gene one enzyme"

- ### 6.1.3: Griffith and Transformation
	- 1928: [[Frederick Griffith]] performed series of experiments w/ 2 strains of *Pneumococcus* bacteria
		- smooth (S) strain: known to be [[virulent]] (deadly)
			- smooth colony type; mice die when injected
			- when heated/killed + injected, mice live (causes chemical change)
		- rough (R) strain: [[avirulent]] (not deadly)
			- produced colonies w/ rough surface + type; mice live when injected
		- when heat-killed smooth *and* normal rough strains are both injected, mice die
			- conclusion: substance present in heat-killed smooth transformed living (rough) strain into smooth bacteria
			- transforming substance: then thought to be genetic material, but not yet identified
