## 6.1: Discovering DNA
- ### 6.1.1: Molecular Genetics: the Protein vs. DNA Debate
	- [[Gregor Mendel]]: described factors that were responsible for passing traits on; didn't know what the factors were
	- coordinated scientific effort to identity genetic material = mid-1800s to mid-1900s
		- at beginning, researchers formalized qualities that the unknown genetic material must possess; 4 qualities:
			- 1. information
				- must store relatively large amt of info, enough to produce cell's [[proteins]] and other structures (bc DNA makes RNA makes proteins)
			- 2. replication
			- 3. communication
			- 4. change
		- **these 4 qualities make up the "brain" of the cell**
	- during 1800s and early 1900s, [[Friedrich Miescher]], [[Robert Feulgen]], and [[Archibald Edward Garrod]] contributed to understanding of the genetic material
		- [[Friedrich Miescher]]: extracted an acidic material from white blood cells' nuclei, calling it [[nucleic acid]]
			- #### type of [[nucleic acid]] found in chromosomes of all [[eukaryotic]] cells: [[DNA]]
			- later, was determined that [[nucleic acid]]s are made up of 4 [[nucleotide]]s: adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine
			- ![[Pasted image 20230816080801.png]]
		- [[Robert Feulgen]]: developed staining technique that could *quantify* DNA; the more DNA present in the nuclei, the darker the stain
		- ![[Pasted image 20230816081940.png]]
			- w/ this, researchers found that **DNA levels are species-specific**
			- across all species, sex cells consistently contained *half* the amount of DNA that the [[autosomal]]/unrelated to sex cells did
		- during this time, most scientists thought that [[protein]] (not [[DNA]]) was genetic material (even w/ evidence)

- ### 6.1.2: Continuing to Link Genes to Chemicals: Muller, Beadle, and Tatum
	- in 1920s: Hermann Muller and Thomas Hunt Morgan furthered genetics field
		- Muller: could increase mutation rate in fruit flies by subjecting them to x-rays
		- ![[Pasted image 20230816082422.png]]
			- 10C increase in temp = doubled mutation rate
	- George Beadle and Edward Tatum: subject red bread mold to x-rays, **greatly increasing mutation rate**
	- ![[Pasted image 20230816082431.png]]
		- normally mold can synthesize almost all of the organic compounds it needs + can be grown on [[minimal medium]] containing a few minerals, 1 vitamin, and an energy src
		- work:
			- 1. spores subjected to x-rays; placed on enriched media containing amino acids and allowed to grow until they produce spores that're collected
			- 2. spores crown on [[minimal media]]; if they can't, then a mutation has occurred bc of x-rays
			- 3. pieces of mutant mold = put in tubes containing minimal media +1 amino acid each; mutant strain can only grow when amino acid [[alanine]] present in tube
			- result indicated that mutation could be linked to defect in specific enzyme (genes + enzymes linked); "one gene one enzyme"

- ### 6.1.3: Griffith and Transformation
	- 1928: [[Frederick Griffith]] performed series of experiments w/ 2 strains of *Pneumococcus* bacteria
	- ![[Pasted image 20230816083107.png]]
		- smooth (S) strain: known to be [[virulent]] (deadly)
			- smooth colony type; mice die when injected
			- when heated/killed + injected, mice live (causes chemical change)
			- ![[Pasted image 20230816083059.png]]
		- rough (R) strain: [[avirulent]] (not deadly)
			- produced colonies w/ rough surface + type; mice live when injected
		- when heat-killed smooth *and* normal rough strai
		- ![[Pasted image 20230816083042.png]]ns are both injected, mice die
			- **conclusion: substance present in heat-killed smooth transformed living (rough) strain into smooth bacteria**
				- transforming substance: then thought to be genetic material, but not yet identified

- ### 6.1.4: Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty/Hershey and Chase: DNA Wins!
	- 1944: [[oswald avery]], [[colin macleod]], and [[maclyn mccarty]] showed that *nucleic acids isolated from heat-killed deadly (S) strain of a [[bacteriophage]]* responsible for *transforming harmless (R) strain deadly*
		- thus, **DNA, not protein, is genetic material**
	- 1952: [[alfred hershey]] and [[martha chase]]: series of experiments involving reproduction of [[bacteriophage]]s, (viruses that infect bacteria)
	- ![[Pasted image 20230816083554.png]]
		- hershey and chase capitalized on fact that *viruses are simple structures w/ 2 basic molecules: a protein coat and DNA*
			- one **had** to be genetic material, capable of using bacteria to produce more viruses
			- sulfur in [[bacteriophage]]: 35S; phosphorus in [[bacteriophage]]: 32P
		- during viral reproduction, protein coats *remained on the outside of the bacterial cells + could be separated w/o affecting viral replication*
			- new viruses produced in bacterial cells = radioactive DNA
		- **demonstrated that DNA is the genetic material**!!!

- ### 6.1.5: Chargaff and Franklin and Wilkins: The DNA Story Begins
	- DNA established as genetic material, so scientists insensified efforts to *characterize DNA's molecular structure*
		- structure must allow 4 basic functions of genetic material (see 6.1.1) which include storage of **large quantities of information**
			- achieved by 4 nucleotide subunits (illustrated below)
			- ![[Pasted image 20230816084015.png]]
				- 2 subuntis: [[purine bases]] (adenine and guanine)
				- other 2 subunits: [[pyrimidine bases]] (thymine and cytosine)
	- 1950: Erwin Chargaff found that **total amount of DNA: SPECIES-SPECIFIC**
		- within a given species amt of adenine relative to thymine = equal, as was amt of cytosine relative to guanine
	- Rosalind Franklin + Maurice Wilkins: used x-ray diffraction to study DNA structure
	- ![[Pasted image 20230816084340.png]]
		- technique involves striking DNA crystals w/ x-rays and photographing resulting diffraction pattern
		- **crisscross pattern provides evidence that DNA = helical in shape**
			- other scientists then used these measurements to furhter their understanding of DNA structure + function

## 6.2: DNA Structure Revealed
- ### 6.2.1: Watson and Crick: The Clues
	- [[James Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]] = first to *accurately* describe [[DNA]] structure
		- constructed hypothetical model that incorporated the Erwin Chargaff's findings + findings of [[Rosalind Franklin]] and [[Maurice Wilkins]]
			- 3 sets of data:
				- 1. chargaff's rules: erwin chargaff found that the amt of adenine and thymine are equal (and the amount of guanine and cytosine) are equal within a species
				- 2. repetitive amt ratios: franklin & wilkins' data showed that some element repeated every 0.34 nm and another repeated every 3.4 nm
				- ![[Pasted image 20230816123533.png]]
					- molecule ~2nm wide
					- prob ties into chargaff's rules
				- 3. shape of molecule: based on [[diffraction]] pattern, DNA molecule appeared helical in shape
			- based on 3 sets of dat
		- [[Linus Pauling]]: contemporary of watson + crick; proposed that DNA consisted of 3 nucleotide strands (incorrect; watson and crick's version proved to be correct)
