title: ATP
### **stores [[energy]] in the cell**

![[ATP structure graph.png]]
- [[chemical energy]]
- [[the secret to life]]
- the extra phosphate in ADP may become an [[inorganic phosphate]]
- ### Uses in cell:
	- mechanical work
	- transport work
	- chemical work
- ## Origin: [[autotrophic]] in nature; produced by the body after taking in raw materials
	- ### $\ce{ADP + P -> ATP}$ (endergonic reaction)
	- composed of ribose

## Function:
- generated via [[respiration]] (both [[aerobic]] and [[anaerobic]])
- [[phosphate bonds]] are unstable bc of [[phosphate group]] crowding (so bonds are weak)
- products of [[ATP]] [[hydrolysis]] ([[ADP]] + P) more stable than [[ATP]]

### how does [[ATP]] release energy?
	[[High-energy bonds]]: **releases energy** when bond is broken
		A - P - ***P ~ P*** ([[ATP]]) --> A - P - P + ***P*** (ADP)
			**phosphate group is separated**
		considered high-energy bc won't likely reform after [[hydrolysis]] + ADP + P is more stable than ATP bc [[electrons]] are in more stable position
	**$\ce{ATP^-^4 + H2O}$ --> $\ce{ADP^-^3 + HPO4^-^2}$**
	[[free energy]] = negative; [[catabolic]] and [[exergonic]] reaction

TARGET DECK: Biology
1. What is the function of ATP? :: ATP serves as a molecule that stores and transfers energy within cells. It is generated through respiration (both aerobic and anaerobic) and is used for mechanical work, transport work, and chemical work in the cell.

2. What is the origin of ATP? :: ATP is autotrophic in nature, meaning it is produced by the body after taking in raw materials. The conversion of ADP and inorganic phosphate (P) to ATP is an endergonic reaction that involves ribose as a component.
<!--ID: 1691315832403-->

    
3. How does ATP release energy? :: ATP releases energy through the breaking of its high-energy bonds. The third phosphate bond in ATP is particularly unstable due to phosphate group crowding, making it weak and prone to breaking. When the bond is broken, ADP and P are formed, and this process releases energy.

4. Why are the products of ATP hydrolysis (ADP + P) more stable than ATP? :: The products of ATP hydrolysis, which are ADP and inorganic phosphate (P), are more stable than ATP because the electrons in the phosphate group are in a more stable position after the hydrolysis reaction. This stability is a result of the phosphate group separation during hydrolysis.

5. What happens during ATP hydrolysis? :: During ATP hydrolysis, the high-energy bond between the second and third phosphate groups in ATP is broken, resulting in the release of energy. The reaction can be represented as ATP^-4 + H2O -> ADP^-3 + HPO4^-2, and it is a catabolic and exergonic reaction with negative free energy.
