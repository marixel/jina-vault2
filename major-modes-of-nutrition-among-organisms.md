[[energy usage is a characteristic of life]]
a [[nutrient]] ([[food]]) provides [[chemical energy]] and raw materials for growth and repair

### How do organisms take in their food?
- [[autotrophic]]: make their own food by taking in raw materials
	- [[autotrophic organisms]]
		- bacteriochlorophyll: example
		- **[[photoautotrophs]]**: use *light* energy to make their own food
		- **[[chemoautotrophs]]**: uses chemical energy *other than light* to make their own food
- [[heterotrophic]]: takes in food from environment
	- so food comes directly from environment, unlike autotrophs (which take and compile components)
	- [[heterotrophic organisms]] (animals, bacteria, fungi, & protists)
		- **[[chemoheterotrophs]]**: animals obtaining energy/carbon from organic compounds
		- **[[photoheterotrophs]]**: uses light as energy source after obtaining carbon from organic compounds
