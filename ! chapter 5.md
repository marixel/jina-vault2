## 5.1: Discovering [[Photosynthesis]]
- ### 5.1.1: The Unraveling of Photosynthesis: A Historical Perspective
	- #### the steps that were made historically in order to 'unravel' the process 
	- [[Photosynthesis]]: process by which plants produce their own food
	- experiments by Van Helmont, joseph Priestly, and Ingenhousz
		- Helmont: planted willow tree in tub; after five years, found that gained 164 lbs and soil had lost 2oz
			- concluded that water was involved in conversion of abiotic (nonliving) material to biotic (living) materials (plant tissues/organic materials)
		- Priestly: placed 2 mice in separate, lidded jars: one was empty and another had a plant. the one in the empty jar died, but the one with the plant survived
			- concluded that plants must be able to produce oxygen; so plants can take in water and form organic materials + oxygen
		- Ingenhousz: found that plants give off oxygen in presence of light and give off some carbon dioxide in the dark
			- concluded that plants use water and light to build plant material + give off oxygen
	- *photosynthesis involves the conversion of light energy and water to produce plant/organic materials and oxygen (and we figured this out from the experiments above)
	- autotrophs and heterotrophs
- ### 5.1.2: Twentieth-Century Breakthroughs
	- experiments by CB Van Neil and Ruben and Kamen led to clearer understanding (we already knew what it was, but not as well as we do today. By now, we only knew the fundamentals)
		- van Neil's hydrogen sulfide experiment: origianlly believed that bacteria could take in CO2, split it, and combine the carbon with H2S (hydrogen sulfide) to make CH2S-type compound and O2 gas
			-  instead, H2S was being split and Co2 combining w/ H to make [[carbohydrates]]; elemental sulfur given off
			- photosynthesis: very similar, only w/ H2O instead of H2S
			- suggested that water may be split in photosynthesis instead of CO2 to produce O2 and [[carbohydrates]]!
