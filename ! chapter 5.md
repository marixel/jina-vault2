## 5.1: Discovering [[Photosynthesis]]
- ### 5.1.1: The Unraveling of Photosynthesis: A Historical Perspective
	- #### the steps that were made historically in order to 'unravel' the process 
	- [[Photosynthesis]]: process by which plants produce their own food
	- experiments by Van Helmont, joseph Priestly, and Ingenhousz
		- Helmont: planted willow tree in tub; after five years, found that gained 164 lbs and soil had lost 2oz
			- concluded that water was involved in conversion of abiotic (nonliving) material to biotic (living) materials (plant tissues/organic materials)
		- Priestly: placed 2 mice in separate, lidded jars: one was empty and another had a plant. the one in the empty jar died, but the one with the plant survived
			- concluded that plants must be able to produce oxygen; so plants can take in water and form organic materials + oxygen
		- Ingenhousz: found that plants give off oxygen in presence of light and give off some carbon dioxide in the dark
			- concluded that plants use water and light to build plant material + give off oxygen
	- *photosynthesis involves the conversion of light energy and water to produce plant/organic materials and oxygen (and we figured this out from the experiments above)
	- autotrophs and heterotrophs
- ### 5.1.2: Twentieth-Century Breakthroughs
	- experiments by CB Van Neil and Ruben and Kamen led to clearer understanding (we already knew what it was, but not as well as we do today. by this point, we only knew the fundamentals)
		- van Neil's hydrogen sulfide experiment: origianlly believed that bacteria could take in CO2, split it, and combine the carbon with H2S (hydrogen sulfide) to make CH2S-type compound and O2 gas
			-  instead, H2S was being split and CO2 combining w/ H to make [[carbohydrates]]; elemental sulfur given off
			- photosynthesis: very similar, only w/ H2O instead of H2S
			- suggested that water may be split in photosynthesis instead of CO2 to produce O2 and [[carbohydrates]]![[Pasted image 20230810033550.png]]
		- Ruben and Kamen: *proved* that **water** is split in photosynthesis, not carbon dioxide w/ isotopes 
			- ***oxygen in water*** was tagged with an isotope and given to plants; oxygen gas produced by these plants also had the isotope
			- water provides [[electron]] source (hydrogens) in formation of [[carbohydrates]] from CO2![[Pasted image 20230810033835.png]]
- ### 5.1.3: [[Photosynthesis]]: The Final Picture
	- Robin Hill's experiment within chloroplasts (2 different types of reactions):
		- one split water to release O2 (required light; seen in images above) ([[photolysis]]/splitting of water by light to produce O2)
		- other didn't need light and attached/fixed H to CO2 to make a carbohydrate (glucose; also known as **carbon fixation**)
		- **experiment process:**
			- [[chloroplasts]] placed in $\ce{CO2}$-deprived environment and added oxidizing agent ($\ce{NADP+}$)
		![[Pasted image 20230810035757.png]]
		
	- $\ce{NADP+}$ = involved in [[oxidation]] (oxidizing agent; accepts [[electrons]]) used in photosynthesis
	- after Hill, Arnon found that chloroplasts without $\ce{CO2}$ could make $\ce{ATP, NADPH + H+, and O2}$ (but *no* glucose!) in light![[Pasted image 20230810035908.png]]
	- there are no carbons to *be* converted into [[carbohydrates]] 
	- **water** is oxidized, **CO2** is reduced
## 5.2: Adaptations for [[Photosynthesis]]
- ### 5.2.1: The Leaf: Adaptations for Photosynthesis
	- *structure follows function*
	- #### upper epidermis: thin layer of cells on upper surface of leaf![[Pasted image 20230810081256.png]]
		- cuticle: waxy, waterproof layer secreted by upper epidermis
	- #### mesophyll: cells in middle of leaf; contains veins that run continuously throughout plant
		- contain [[chloroplasts]] (organelles containing chlorophyll, or a light-absorbing pigment)
	- #### lower epidermis: layer of cells on underside of leaf![[Pasted image 20230810081228.png]]
		- *stomata*: openings formed by 2 **guard cells** (they literally guard; the stomata is open at day and closed at night) that are found in lower epidermis
			- $\ce{CO2}$ enters leaf through stomata
			- water evaporates from [[mesophyll]] and out of stomata
			- water in veins of mesophyll moves up to replace water that evaporated
- ### 5.2.2: The Structure of a Chloroplast
	- #### Chloroplasts: organelles found mostly in mesophyll cells (in middle of leaf) and are site of [[photosynthesis]]
		- *structure follows function*
		- ### structure:
			- double-membrane with green spots within them
			- spots: interconnected stacks of *granum*, (or plural *grana*; hollowed out membranes)
			- each granum = made up of enclosed membrane (thylakoids)
				- composed of [[lipid]] bilayer w/ [[proteins]] accumulated into *aggregates* (groups) embedded within![[Pasted image 20230810082258.png]]
				- aggregates: light-harvesting antennae of [[chloroplasts]] (chlorophyll is also found there)
			- therefore: third membrane within two outer membranes (3 layers in total)![[Pasted image 20230810082239.png]]
			- chlorophyll: pigment that absorbs light
				- porphyrin ring: light-reactive end of molecule; involved in photosynthesis' light reactions![[Pasted image 20230810082317.png]]
				- lower end (not shown in diagram) = nonpolar hydrocarbon tail (which interacts w/ other nonpolar regions of proteins + membrane to anchor molecule into membrane) aka, holds it in place
- ### 5.2.3: Photosynthetic Pigments
	- #### pigment: substance able to absorb light
		- photosynthetic pigments (ex. chlorophyll): able to absorb light so that its energy can build carbs during photosynthesis
		- ##### chlorophyll: green pigment embedded in thylakoid membrane of [[chloroplasts]]
			- Chlorophyll a: involved directly in photosynthesis' light reactions (light energy --> carbs)
			- others:
				- chlorophyll b
				- cartenoids
		- ##### Engelmann
