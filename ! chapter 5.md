## 5.1: Discovering [[Photosynthesis]]
- ### 5.1.1: The Unraveling of Photosynthesis: A Historical Perspective
	- #### the steps that were made historically in order to 'unravel' the process 
	- [[Photosynthesis]]: process by which plants produce their own food
	- experiments by Van Helmont, joseph Priestly, and Ingenhousz
		- Helmont: planted willow tree in tub; after five years, found that gained 164 lbs and soil had lost 2oz
			- concluded that water was involved in conversion of abiotic (nonliving) material to biotic (living) materials (plant tissues/organic materials)
		- Priestly: placed 2 mice in separate, lidded jars: one was empty and another had a plant. the one in the empty jar died, but the one with the plant survived
			- concluded that plants must be able to produce oxygen; so plants can take in water and form organic materials + oxygen
		- Ingenhousz: found that plants give off oxygen in presence of light and give off some carbon dioxide in the dark
			- concluded that plants use water and light to build plant material + give off oxygen
	- *photosynthesis involves the conversion of light energy and water to produce plant/organic materials and oxygen (and we figured this out from the experiments above)
	- autotrophs and heterotrophs
- ### 5.1.2: Twe
- ntieth-Century Breakthroughs
	- experiments by CB Van Neil and Ruben and Kamen led to clearer understanding (we already knew what it was, but not as well as we do today. by this point, we only knew the fundamentals)
		- van Neil's hydrogen sulfide experiment: origianlly believed that bacteria could take in CO2, split it, and combine the carbon with H2S (hydrogen sulfide) to make CH2S-type compound and O2 gas
			-  instead, H2S was being split and CO2 combining w/ H to make [[carbohydrates]]; elemental sulfur given off
			- photosynthesis: very similar, only w/ H2O instead of H2S
			- suggested that water may be split in photosynthesis instead of CO2 to produce O2 and [[carbohydrates]]![[Pasted image 20230810033550.png]]
		- Ruben and Kamen: *proved* that **water** is split in photosynthesis, not carbon dioxide w/ isotopes 
			- ***oxygen in water*** was tagged with an isotope and given to plants; oxygen gas produced by these plants also had the isotope
			- water provides [[electron]] source (hydrogens) in formation of [[carbohydrates]] from CO2![[Pasted image 20230810033835.png]]
- ### 5.1.3: [[Photosynthesis]]: The Final Picture
	- Robin Hill's experiment within chloroplasts (2 different types of reactions):
		- one split water to release O2 (required light; seen in images above) ([[photolysis]]/splitting of water by light to produce O2)
		- other didn't need light and attached/fixed H to CO2 to make a carbohydrate (glucose; also known as **carbon fixation**)
		- **experiment process:**
			- [[chloroplasts]] placed in $\ce{CO2}$-deprived environment and added oxidizing agent ($\ce{NADP+}$)
		![[Pasted image 20230810035757.png]]
		
	- $\ce{NADP+}$ = involved in [[oxidation]] (oxidizing agent; accepts [[electrons]]) used in photosynthesis
	- after Hill, Arnon found that chloroplasts without $\ce{CO2}$ could make $\ce{ATP, NADPH + H+, and O2}$ (but *no* glucose!) in light![[Pasted image 20230810035908.png]]
	- there are no carbons to *be* converted into [[carbohydrates]] 
	- **water** is oxidized, **CO2** is reduced

## 5.2: Adaptations for [[Photosynthesis]]
- ### 5.2.1: The Leaf: Adaptations for Photosynthesis
	- *structure follows function*
	- #### upper epidermis: thin layer of cells on upper surface of leaf![[Pasted image 20230810081256.png]]
		- cuticle: waxy, waterproof layer secreted by upper epidermis
	- #### mesophyll: cells in middle of leaf; contains veins that run continuously throughout plant
		- contain [[chloroplasts]] (organelles containing chlorophyll, or a light-absorbing pigment)
	- #### lower epidermis: layer of cells on underside of leaf![[Pasted image 20230810081228.png]]
		- *stomata*: openings formed by 2 **guard cells** (they literally guard; the stomata is open at day and closed at night) that are found in lower epidermis
			- $\ce{CO2}$ enters leaf through stomata
			- water evaporates from [[mesophyll]] and out of stomata
			- water in veins of mesophyll moves up to replace water that evaporated
- ### 5.2.2: The Structure of a Chloroplast
	- #### Chloroplasts: organelles found mostly in mesophyll cells (in middle of leaf) and are site of [[photosynthesis]]
		- *structure follows function*
		- ### structure:
			- double-membrane with green spots within them
			- spots: interconnected stacks of *granum*, (or plural *grana*; hollowed out membranes)
			- each granum = made up of enclosed membrane (thylakoids)
				- composed of [[lipid]] bilayer w/ [[proteins]] accumulated into *aggregates* (groups) embedded within![[Pasted image 20230810082258.png]]
				- aggregates: light-harvesting antennae of [[chloroplasts]] (chlorophyll is also found there)
			- therefore: third membrane within two outer membranes (3 layers in total)![[Pasted image 20230810082239.png]]
			- chlorophyll: pigment that absorbs light
				- porphyrin ring: light-reactive end of molecule; involved in photosynthesis' light reactions![[Pasted image 20230810082317.png]]
				- lower end (not shown in diagram) = nonpolar hydrocarbon tail (which interacts w/ other nonpolar regions of proteins + membrane to anchor molecule into membrane) aka, holds it in place
- ### 5.2.3: Photosynthetic Pigments
	- #### pigment: substance able to absorb light
		- photosynthetic pigments (ex. chlorophyll): able to absorb light so that its energy can build carbs during photosynthesis
		- ##### chlorophyll: green pigment embedded in thylakoid membrane of [[chloroplasts]]
			- Chlorophyll a: involved directly in photosynthesis' light reactions (light energy --> carbs)
			- others:
				- chlorophyll b
				- cartenoids
		- ##### Engelmann's experiment: algae able to use blue + red wavelengths of light more effectively than green for photosynthesis![[Pasted image 20230810083037.png]]
			- contextual meaning: 
			- process:
				- white light split into component colors + shone along length of alga
				- used aerobic bacteria that clustered around oxygen to determine which part of alga was releasing oxygen (bc they'd gravitate towards that area)
				- bacteria clustered around areas clustered around green + blue light, and not around green light, demonstrating the **action spectrum** for photosynthesis (different activity at different wavelengths)
				- ##### action spectrum: shows effectiveness of different wavelengths of light on [[photosynthesis]] (or measures activity at diff. wavelengths) ![[Pasted image 20230810083736.png]]
			- photosynthetic activity happens at 'lower' levels bc of *accessory pigments* (chlorophyll b and carotenoids)
			- **absorption spectrum** of chlorophyll b peaks = absorption of chlorophyll a starts to drop
				- + carotenoids absorb wavelengths that chlorophylls a and b can't (so they all complement each other)
- ### 5.2.4: The Nature of Light
	- #### light has the properties of both [[waves]] and [[particles]]
		- can be described as discrete packets of energy called [[photons]]
	- #### photoelectric effec/photoexcitationt: light's ability to excite electrons to higher energy levels
		- different wavelengths = diff amt of energy able to excite electrons into *discreet* energy levels
			- when [[chlorophyll]] is hit with light, an electron is excited and then falls back down to its ground state          ![[Pasted image 20230810084506.png]]
			- when hit with UV light, electron within it = excited, gains energy (example)
			- when electron falls back down to ground state, it gives off/loses energy in the form of [[photons]] (a single photon for each [[electron]])
	- ***concept question***: instead of allowing excited electron to fall, why not use it to reduce a coenzyme like $\ce{NADP+}$? (would allow energy to be stored and used for synthesis of molecules like glucose)
		- plants utilize this in a way to convert light energy into carbs, sustenance, and other products. this will be explored throughout chapter and in next subchapter (see 5.2.5: photoexcitation and electron transfer)
		- ![[Pasted image 20230810084552.png]]
- ### 5.2.5: Photoexcitation and Electron Transfer
	- #### Photoexcitation:
	- ![[Pasted image 20230810085519.png]]
		- when a pigment absorbs [[photons]], an electron in the molecule will gain energy + be promoted from its **ground state** (normal energetic state) to an **excited state**. (elevated further out from center of atom)
			- in excited state, electron = unstable and will soon drop back down to ground state (og state)
		- aka, the absorption of light excites electrons
		- when electron in *chlorophyll a* reaches excites state:
			- passed directly to protein receiver in thylakoid membrane
			- other pigments in chloroplast able to pass excited electrons to *chlorophyll a*
		- electron transferred through a series of proteins in thylakoid membrane (gives off energy at each step bc of these transfers)
			- in thylakoid membrane, light-harvesting complexes called **photosystems**![[Pasted image 20230810085540.png]]
				- inside photosystem = reaction center (where light-driven reactions of photosynthesis begin) (remember that not all of photosynthesis' reactions are light-driven, robin hill's experiment)
				- excited electron from *chlorophyll a* in reaction center passed onto protein acceptor, *reducing* the acceptor (more negative)
				- proteins arranged within thylakoid membrane to accept + pass energized electrons through a series of redox reactions, giving off energy at each step (which is then used to create ATP!)

## 5.3: The Light Reactions
- ### 5.3.1: The Light Reactions: An Introduction
	- #### thylakoid = enclosed membrane within [[chloroplasts]] where the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis happen/take place
	- ![[Pasted image 20230810091459.png]]
		- light-harvesting antennae (or photosystems!) = complexes of pigment molecules found in thylakoid membrane
			- here, energy from light = gathered and eventually used to help fuel light-dependent reactions
		- proteins embedded in thylakoid membrane able to accept + pass excited electrons from *chlorophyll a* through redox r
		- ![[Pasted image 20230810091519.png]]eactions (giving off energy as they go; this energy fuels ATP synthesis)
			- energy lost by electrons = used to create proton gradient in *lumen* of thylakoid; diffusion of protons through *ATP synthase* fuels ATP production
			- final electron acceptor = $\ce{NADP+}$ which becomes $\ce{NADPH + H+}$ when reduced
- ### 5.3.2: Photosystem 1
	- #### light-harvesting antennae/photosystems found in thylakoid and consist of proteins, chlorophyll, and other pigments and molecules
		- reaction center: chlorophyll molecule next to *primary electron acceptor*, which is able to accept an excited electron
		- two photosystems (1 and 2)
			- each = light-harvesting unit, work together to produce ATP and NADPH
	- also known as P700 bc its *reaction center* best at absorbing 700 nanometers (nm)
	- ![[Pasted image 20230810092535.png]]
		- electron from *chlorophyll a* in reaction center = excited by a photon of light before being passed to *primary electron acceptor*
		- *primary electron acceptor* passse electron to **ferredoxin (Fd)**, a protein within the thylakoid membrane
		- from ferredoxcin, electron passed to $\ce{NADP+}$, which gets reduced to NADPH![[Pasted image 20230810092557.png]]
			- if buildup of NADPH, *cyclic electron flow* happens
				- excited electron passed from chlorophyll a in photosystem 1 to primary electron acceptor to ferredoxin, but is passed down electron transport chain instead of being passed to $\ce{NADP+}$
				- as electron goes down electron transport chain, it loses energy; membrane proteins use this energy to pump protons into *lumen* of the thylakoid
				- electron eventually returns to chlorophyll a in photosystem 1 (process repeats(?))
				- protons in thylakoid membrane = allowed to pass through point of ATP synthase where ADP is phosphorylated to make ATP
					- production of ATP from cyclic electron flow = **photophosphorylation**
- ### 5.3.3: Photosystem 2
	- #### here, electron excited by light and passed to primary electron acceptor, which passes it down an electron transport chain (losing energy as it goes) leading to ATP synthesis
	- ![[Pasted image 20230810093725.png]]
		- ##### energy lost in these redox reactions is used to pump protons (H+) into thylakoid's lume; proton gradient fuels ATP production via enzyme complex ****ATP Synthase****
		- after photosystem 1 loses electron to make NADPH, it receives an electron from photosystem 2's ETC (from final acceptor of electron in ps 2)
		- [[photolysis]] takes place in order to provide electrons to photosystem 2 as they are lost (bc *chlorophyll a* in photosystem 2 loses excited electrons)
		- ![[Pasted image 20230810093836.png]]
			- water split into 2 hydrogen ions + 1 oxygen atom; oxygen atom combines with another to form O2 (one of the 3 products)
		- end products of photosystems 1 and 2 (**light reactions**): $\ce{ATP, NADPH + H+, and O2}$ 
- ### 5.3.4: The Light Reactions: A Summary
	- #### mesophyll > chloroplasts > thylakoid > photosystems
	- ![[Pasted image 20230810094821.png]]
		- photosystems = groups of proteins, pigments, and other molecules + site of light reactions (reactions w/ light, literally)
			- in photosystem 1, an excited electron is used to reduce $\ce{NADP+}$ to $\ce{NADPH + H+}$
				- electron --> ferredoxin, then used to reduce $\ce{NADP+}$ to $\ce{NADPH + H+}$
				- electron hole created in photosystem 1 = filled in with electron from photosystem 2
			- cyclic electron flow happens in ps 1 when NADPH builds up (instead of reducing NADP+, electron is passed down an electron transport chain until it returns to ps 1)
			- in ps 2, an excited electron is passed down an ETC of proteins to pump protons into lumen for ATP synthesis (bc energy released as electron travels through ETC)
			- ![[Pasted image 20230810094837.png]]
				- photolysis of water gives electrons to photosystem 2 and produces oxygen and H+ (or a proton) in the lumen of thylakoid

## 5.4: The Dark Reactions
- ### 5.4.1: The Calvin Cycle
	- #### light-independent series of reactions involving synthesis of carbs from CO2
	- ![[Pasted image 20230810095123.png]]
		- reaction *cannot* spontaneously go from low energy -> high energy; energy input is necessary
			- in light-dependent reactions, this energy comes from the sun (makes ATP and NADPH)
			- the goal is to make carbs!!!
		- synthesis glucose from CO2 required enzymes + energy input (bc spontaneous cannot go from low -> high)
			- ![[Pasted image 20230810100452.png]]
		- CO2 and water have lower free energy than glucose, so bc there's a positive difference, energy needs to be inputted for reaction to happen
	- stage 1: carbon fixation (incorporation of carbon in CO2 into a larger molecule)
	- ![[Pasted image 20230810100440.png]]
		- takes place when Co2 added to *ribulose bisphosphate* (RuBP), a 5-carbon sugar, by enzyme *rubisco*
		- 6-carbon molecule formed, which then splits into 2 three-carbon molecules called 3 phosphoglycerate (3PG)
	- stage 2/reduction stage: phosphate group from ATP transferred to each 3PG to form 1,3-biphosphoglycerate
	- ![[Pasted image 20230810100759.png]]
		- NADPH reduces this and phosphate is removed to form *glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate*, which is the **first product of photosynthesis**
		- **so... where's the glucose? is its production related to rubisco?**
- ### 5.4.2: The Calvin Cycle: RuBP Regeneration
	- ![[Pasted image 20230810120436.png]]
	- during carbon cycle, carbon fixed onto RuBP by *rubisco* to form 3-phosphoglycerate (which is then phosphorylated and reduced to give rise to **glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate**)
	- RuBP then regenerated through complex series of reactions to continue cycle
	- cycle must make three turns to synthesize *one* **glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate**
		- carbon molecules fixed to RuBP; 3 new 6-carbon molecules then split apart to make six 3-carbon molecules called 3-phosphoglycerate (phase 1)
		- 3-phosphoglycerate molecules reduced to form glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P); one of these molecules is released from cycle for use by plant cell, so five are left behind (phase 2)
		- through complex series of reactions, five 3-carbon G3P molecules are used to regenerate three 5-carbon RuBP molecules to continue the cycle
	- G3P is the **starting material** used for production of glucose in other pathways
- ### 5.4.3: A Review of Photosynthesis
	- in light reactions, light energy converted into chemical energy **in the form of NADPH and ATP**
		- light excites an electron in *chlorophyll a*, causing the chlorophyll to lose the electron
		- energy released by excited electrons in ETCs used to pump proteins into thylakoid's lumen
		- electron passed to NADP+ to form NADPH
		- water split + loses electrons, producing O2 and H+ ions in lumen of thylakoid
			- these H+ ions (or protons) pass through ATP synthase, which produces ATP
		- at photosystem 2, *monocyclic electron flow* occurs (cycles once)
		- at photosystem 1, *cyclic electron flow* takes place when NADPH builds up (process cycles/repeats)
	- in the **calvin cycle**, CO2 fixed to ribulose biphosphate (RuBP) to (eventually) form glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (builds glucose + other materials)
		- in process, ATP and NADPH from light reactions are used
	- mitochondria and chloroplasts are very similar, suggesting a common ancestry
	- ![[Pasted image 20230810121422.png]]
		- mitochondria: organelles that convert energy stored in glucose into ATP (glucose --> ATP)
			- inner and outer membrane
			- proteins like ATP sunthase, NADH reductase, and FADH2 reductase present (recognize their roles and be able to place them)
			- protons pumped into *intermembrane space* + allowed to **diffuse** back into mitochondrial matrix (interior) through enzyme complex ATP synthase (which produces ATP in the process)
		- chloroplasts: organelles found in plants that convert light energy --> chemical energy
			- inner and outer membrane
				- inner membrane network: thylakoid membrane
			- proteins like ATP synthase and NADP+ reductase are present
			- protons pumped into lumen of thylakoid + allowe dto diffuse back into stroma of chloroplast through ATP synthase (which produces ATP in the process)
## 5.5: Photorespiration
- ### 5.5.1: Photorespiration
	- photorespiration: process by which oxygen (O2) is consumed by rubisco + added into Calvin cycle instead of CO2 (process produces no ATP)
		- may be evolutionary remnant from when the atmosphere contained a much higher level of CO2 and less O2 than today
		- guard cells of plant leaf = usually open during day; during dry, hot conditions they close to conserve water
		- ![[Pasted image 20230810122318.png]]
			- this closing can cause problem for photosynthesis (rubisco will put oxygen into calvin cycle instead of CO2, causing O2 to build up from light reactions)
			- when rubisco incorporates O2 into calvin cycle instead of CO2, 5-carbon molecule results
			- ![[Pasted image 20230810122334.png]]
			- this 5-carbon molecule = splits into 2-carbon and 3-carbon molecule (latter goes back into calvin cycle and former leaves chloroplast + broken down to form CO2 in *peroxisome* and mitochondria
		- **counterproductive** to plants bc no ATP produced + carbon directed out of the Calvin cycle
- ### 5.5.2: Plants and CAM Plants
	- #### C4 and CAM plants = special adaptations that allow them to avoid problem of photorespiration
		- C4 plants avoid photorespiration by using alt. form of *carbon fixation* (which takes place in the mesophyll cells)
		- ![[Pasted image 20230810123449.png]]
			- *bundle sheath cells* line veins of C4 plants; Calvin cycle takes place in chloroplasts of bundle sheath cells
			- in these plants, CO2 is fixed to a molecule called *phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxylase* within mesophyll cells
			- ![[Pasted image 20230810123316.png]]
				- reaction forms molecule oxaloacetate, which is then converted into malate (which then diffuses into bundle sheath cells where it is broken down into CO2 and pyruvate)
				- CO2 released enters Calvin cycle and pyruvate returns to mesophyll cells + converted back into PEP
			- overall, **C4 plants avoid photorespiration by fixing CO2 in a separate location from the Calvin cycle*
		- CAM plants fix CO2 at different *time* than Calvin cycle (not location!)
		- ![[Pasted image 20230810123259.png]]
			- these plants have stomata closed during day + open at night; water loss minimized this way
			- when stomata open at night, CO2 taken up and incorporated into acids
			- during the day acids release this CO2, which then enters Calvin Cycle
- ### 5.5.3: The Evolution of Photosynthesis
	- #### photosynthesis evolved by adapting *existing system* into photosynthetic *machinery*
		- evolution of photosynthesis required an antenna to absorb light, a living cell, and the constraints of the Earth's ancient environment
		- evolution likely included **bacteriorhodopsin** as the pigment, a member of Archaea as the organism, and H2S as the protein source (see van Niel's experiment in 5.1)
		- ![[Pasted image 20230810124217.png]]
			- bacteriorhodopsin: found in some Archaea; serves as 'antenna' for light
		- first cell that developed photosynthetic capabilities needed a battery to drive ATP production (in modern cells, this is a gradient of hydrogen ions/proton gradient in the thylakoid membrane)
		- ![[Pasted image 20230810124240.png]]
		- ancient photosynthetic unit = likely had bacteriorhodopsin acting as antenna and a gradient of hydrogen ions drove synthesis of ATP
		- ![[Pasted image 20230810124303.png]]
			- proton source may have been H2S (since there was a lot in the ancient seas) that was split into hydrogen ions and elemental sulfur
			- ![[Pasted image 20230810124357.png]]
				- currently exploited by purple sulfur bacteria, first used by cyanobacteria (unit 1 review)
